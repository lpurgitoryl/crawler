        "body":"It is omnipresent!\n\n**First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).\n\n**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.\n\n**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name \"neural\" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the \"godfathers\" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.\n\n**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.\n\n**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.\n\n**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a \"broader impact\" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).\n\n**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS\/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.\n\n**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.\n\nAlbert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. \n\nThe moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies. \n\nBest intentions, Yusuf",

We're at risk now of other major players, who previously at least published their work and contributed to open source tools, close themselves off as well.\n\nAI alignment is a serious issue that we definitely have not solved. Its a huge field with a dizzying array of ideas, beliefs and approaches. We're talking about trying to capture the interests and goals of all humanity, after all. In this space, the one approach that is horrifying (and the one that OpenAI was LITERALLY created to prevent) is a singular or oligarchy of for profit corporations making this decision for us. This is exactly what OpenAI plans to do.\n\nI get it, GPT4 is incredible. However, we are talking about the single most transformative technology and societal change that humanity has ever made. It needs to be for everyone or else the average person is going to be left behind.\n\nWe need to unify around open source development; choose companies that contribute to science, and condemn the ones that don't.\n\nThis conversation will only ever get more important.",

Now you can probably be hired most places. If you need resume filler, so some Kaggle competitions. If you have debugging questions, use StackOverflow. If you have math questions, read more. If you have life questions, I have no idea.",

Believe it or not, this algorithm already exists as early as iOS 14.3, hidden under obfuscated class names. After some digging and reverse engineering on the hidden APIs I managed to export its model (which is MobileNetV3) to ONNX and rebuild the whole NeuralHash algorithm in Python. You can now try NeuralHash even on Linux!\n\nSource code: [https:\/\/github.com\/AsuharietYgvar\/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX](https:\/\/github.com\/AsuharietYgvar\/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX)\n\nNo pre-exported model file will be provided here for obvious reasons. But it's very easy to export one yourself following the guide I included with the repo above. You don't even need any Apple devices to do it.\n\nEarly tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations.\n\nHope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it's enabled on all iOS devices.\n\nHappy hacking!",

It's just that, take the recent \"An Evolutionary Approach to Dynamic Introduction of Tasks in Large-scale Multitask Learning Systems\" paper. It's 18 pages of talking through this pretty convoluted evolutionary and multitask learning algorithm, it's pretty interesting, solves a bunch of problems. But two notes. \n\nOne, the big number they cite as the success metric is 99.43 on CIFAR-10, against a SotA of 99.40, so woop-de-fucking-doo in the grand scheme of things.\n\nTwo, there's a chart towards the end of the paper that details how many TPU core-hours were used for just the training regimens that results in the final results. The sum total is 17,810 core-hours. Let's assume that for someone who doesn't work at Google, you'd have to use on-demand pricing of $3.22\/hr. This means that these trained models cost $57,348. \n\nStrictly speaking, throwing enough compute at a general enough genetic algorithm will eventually produce arbitrarily good performance, so while you can absolutely read this paper and collect interesting ideas about how to use genetic algorithms to accomplish multitask learning by having each new task leverage learned weights from previous tasks by defining modifications to a subset of components of a pre-existing model, there's a meta-textual level on which this paper is just \"Jeff Dean spent enough money to feed a family of four for half a decade to get a 0.03% improvement on CIFAR-10.\"\n\nOpenAI is far and away the worst offender here, but it seems like everyone's doing it. You throw a fuckton of compute and a light ganache of new ideas at an existing problem with existing data and existing benchmarks, and then if your numbers are infinitesimally higher than their numbers, you get to put a lil' sticker on your CV. Why should I trust that your ideas are even any good? I can't check them, I can't apply them to my own projects. \n\nIs this really what we're comfortable with as a community? A handful of corporations and the occasional university waving their dicks at everyone because they've got the compute to burn and we don't? There's a level at which I think there should be a new journal, exclusively for papers in which you can replicate their experimental results in under eight hours on a single consumer GPU.",

The slog is to go through the jargon (that keeps changing beneath your feet - what's the point of using fancy words if you can't keep them consistent?), the unnecessary equations, trying to squeeze meaning from bullshit language used in papers, figuring out the super important steps, preprocessing, hyperparameters optimization that the authors, oops, failed to mention.\n\nSorry for singling out, but [look at this](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/end-to-end-negotiator\/blob\/master\/src\/agent.py) - what the fuck? If a developer anywhere else at Facebook would get this code for a review they would throw up.\n\n- Do you intentionally try to obfuscate your papers? Is pseudo-code a fucking premium? Can you at least try to give some intuition before showering the reader with equations?\n\n- How the fuck do you dare to release a paper without source code?\n\n- Why the fuck do you never ever add comments to you code?\n\n- When naming things, are you charged by the character? Do you get a bonus for acronyms?\n\n- Do you realize that OpenAI having needed to release a \"baseline\" TRPO implementation is a fucking disgrace to your profession?\n\n- Jesus christ, who decided to name a tensor concatenation function `cat`?\n",

        "body":"I recently encountered the PaLM (Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways) paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express \u2013 and I know I can\u2019t be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI \u2013 Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc. \u2013 would think if they could see the state of AI that we\u2019ve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldn\u2019t process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution \u2013 bias, racism, malicious use, etc. \u2013 for purposes that who asked for?\n\nWhen I started my career as an AI\/ML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks \u2013 1.) those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and non-scalable. I\u2019m talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2.) tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons \u2013 forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder.\n\nThis is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslows\u2019s hierarchy of needs in terms of self-actualization \u2013 art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves \u2013 the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10% can do them decently, and 1% or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AI-generation is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we won\u2019t be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAlmost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT-3, CODEX, DALL-E, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is long-term convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If you\u2019re an artist or writer and you\u2019re using DALL-E or GPT-3 to \u201cenhance\u201d your work, or if you\u2019re a programmer saying, \u201cGitHub Co-Pilot makes me a better programmer?\u201d, then how could you possibly know? You\u2019ve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts -> (optionally words) -> actions -> feedback -> repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you can\u2019t understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it.\n\nWhen I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking \u2013 that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they weren\u2019t that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the drug-induced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of \u2013 if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the long-term timeframe that crosses generations, there\u2019s significant risk that current AI-generation developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly won\u2019t even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of auto-correction hasn\u2019t made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years (a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating).\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019ve yet to set anyone discuss the train \u2013 generate \u2013 train - generate feedback loop that long-term application of AI-generation systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AI-generated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back?\n\nBy relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, I\u2019m convinced that we as AI\/ML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that we\u2019ve made, as well as a prisoner\u2019s dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction we\u2019ve chosen for short-term gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it \u2013 our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.\n\nIf you\u2019re an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when you\u2019ve spent years on years building your career in this direction? You\u2019re likely making near or north of $200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so it\u2019s too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If you\u2019re a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if you\u2019re a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your team\u2019s billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You can\u2019t \u2013 the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If you\u2019re a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China single-mindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be pre-emptively admitting defeat.\n\nEven assuming that none of what I\u2019ve described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything I\u2019m saying is fear-mongering and non-sense, then I\u2019d be interested in hearing what you think human-AI co-existence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isn\u2019t as demoralizing as I\u2019ve made it out to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Day after posting this -- this post took off way more than I expected. Even if I received 20 - 25 comments, I would have considered that a success, but this went much further. Thank you to each one of you that has read this post, even more so if you left a comment, and triply so for those who gave awards! I've read almost every comment that has come in (even the troll ones), and am truly grateful for each one, including those in sharp disagreement. I've learned much more from this discussion with the sub than I could have imagined on this topic, from so many perspectives. While I will try to reply as many comments as I can, the sheer comment volume combined with limited free time between work and family unfortunately means that there are many that I likely won't be able to get to. That will invariably include some that I would love respond to under the assumption of infinite time, but I will do my best, even if the latency stretches into days. Thank you all once again!",

I'm curious to hear what you all think.\n\nIt appears that Siraj recently offered a course \"Make Money with Machine Learning\" with a registration fee but did not follow through with promises made in the initial offering of the course. On top of that, he created a refund and warranty page with information regarding the course *after* people already paid. Here is a link to a WayBackMachine captures of u\/klarken's documentation of Siraj's potential misdeeds: [case for a refund](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/save\/https:\/\/case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/feedback.html), [discussion in course Discord](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190923211614\/https:\/\/case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/reference_messages.png), [\\~1200 individuals in the course](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190923211815\/https:\/\/case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/members.png), [Multiple Slack channel discussion, students hidden from each other](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190923211940\/https:\/\/case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/multiple_slack_channels.png), [\"Hundreds refunded\"](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190923212113\/https:\/\/case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/hundreds_refunded.png)\n\nAccording to Twitter threads, he has been banning anyone in his Discord\/Slack that has been asking for refunds.\n\nOn top of this there are many Twitter threads regarding his behavior. A screenshot (bottom of post) of an account that has since been deactivated\/deleted (he made the account to try and get Siraj's attention). Here is a Twitter WayBackMachine archive link of a search for the user in the screenshot: [https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190921130513\/https:\/twitter.com\/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed\\_query](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190921130513\/https:\/twitter.com\/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed_query). In the search results it is apparent that there are many students who have been impacted by Siraj.\n\nUPDATE 1: Additional searching on Twitter has yielded many more posts, check out the tweets\/retweets of these people: [student1](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/save\/https:\/twitter.com\/ReneeSLiu1) [student2](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190921133155\/https:\/\/twitter.com\/Aravind56898077)\n\nUPDATE 2: A user mentioned that I should ask a question on r\/legaladvice regarding the legality of the refusal to refund and whatnot. I have done so [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/d7gopa\/independent_online_course_false_advertising_and\/). It appears that per California commerce law (where the School of AI is registered) individuals have the right to ask for a refund for 30 days.\n\nUPDATE 3: Siraj has replied to the post below, and on [Twitter](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190922213957\/https:\/\/twitter.com\/sirajraval\/status\/1175864213916372992?s=09) (Way Back Machine capture)\n\nUPDATE 4: Another student has shared their interactions via [this Imgur post](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/msAdqBn).

It is related to a few previous popular posts on this subreddit with high upvotes, which prompted me to post this [story](https:\/\/www.icij.org\/investigations\/china-cables\/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm\/).\n\nPrevious related stories:\n\n- [Is machine learning's killer app totalitarian surveillance and oppression?](https:\/\/redd.it\/c9n1u2)\n\n- [Using CV for surveillance and regression for threat scoring citizens in Xinjiang](https:\/\/redd.it\/7kzflw)\n\n- [ICCV 19: The state of some ethically questionable papers](https:\/\/redd.it\/dp389c)\n\n- [Hikvision marketed ML surveillance camera that automatically identifies Uyghurs](https:\/\/redd.it\/dv5axp)\n\n- [Working on an ethically questionnable project...](https:\/\/redd.it\/dw7sms)\n\nThe **[story](https:\/\/www.icij.org\/investigations\/china-cables\/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm\/)** reports the details of a new leak of highly classified Chinese government documents reveals the operations manual for running the mass detention camps in Xinjiang and exposed the mechanics of the region\u2019s system of mass surveillance.\n\n**The [lead journalist](https:\/\/twitter.com\/BethanyAllenEbr\/status\/1198663008152621057)'s summary of findings**\n\nThe China Cables represent the first leak of a classified Chinese government document revealing the inner workings of the detention camps, as well as the first leak of classified government documents unveiling the predictive policing system in Xinjiang.\n\nThe leak features classified intelligence briefings that reveal, in the government\u2019s own words, how Xinjiang police essentially take orders from a massive \u201ccybernetic brain\u201d known as IJOP, which flags entire categories of people for investigation & detention.\n\nThese secret intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government\u2019s AI-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on computer-generated findings alone. The result? Arrest by algorithm.\n\n**The article describe methods used for algorithmic policing**\n\nThe classified intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government\u2019s artificial-intelligence-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on these computer-generated findings alone. Experts say the platform, which is used in both policing and military contexts, demonstrates the power of technology to help drive industrial-scale human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese [government] have bought into a model of policing where they believe that through the collection of large-scale data run through artificial intelligence and machine learning that they can, in fact, predict ahead of time where possible incidents might take place, as well as identify possible populations that have the propensity to engage in anti-state anti-regime action,\u201d said Mulvenon, the SOS International document expert and director of intelligence integration. \u201cAnd then they are preemptively going after those people using that data.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the predictive policing aspect of the article, there are side [articles](https:\/\/qz.com\/1755018\/chinas-manual-for-uighur-detention-camps-revealed-in-data-leak\/) about the entire ML stack, including how [mobile apps](https:\/\/www.icij.org\/investigations\/china-cables\/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app\/) are used to target Uighurs, and also how the inmates are [re-educated](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-china-50511063) once inside the concentration camps. The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled.\n\n*Note: My motivation for posting this story is to raise ethical concerns and awareness in the research community. I do not want to heighten levels of racism towards the Chinese research community (not that it may matter, but I am Chinese). See this [thread](https:\/\/redd.it\/e10b5x) for some context about what I don't want these discussions to become.*\n\n*I am aware of the fact that the Chinese government's policy is to integrate the state and the people as one, so accusing the party is perceived domestically as insulting the Chinese people, but I also believe that we as a research community is intelligent enough to be able to separate government, and those in power, from individual researchers. We as a community should keep in mind that there are many Chinese researchers (in mainland and abroad) who are not supportive of the actions of the CCP, but they may not be able to voice their concerns due to personal risk.*\n\n**Edit** Suggestion from \/u\/DunkelBeard:\n\nWhen discussing issues relating to the Chinese government, try to use the term CCP, Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government, or Beijing. Try *not* to use only the term *Chinese* or *China* when describing the government, as it may be misinterpreted as referring to the Chinese people (either citizens of China, or people of Chinese ethnicity), if that is not your intention. As mentioned earlier, conflating China and the CCP is actually a tactic of the CCP.",

Redacting identifying information as the author has appeared to make rectifications, and it\u2019d be pretty damaging if this is what came up when googling their name \/ GitHub (hopefully they\u2019ve learned a career lesson and can move on). \n\n**TL;DR:** A PhD candidate claimed to have achieved 97% accuracy for coronavirus from chest x-rays. Their post gathered thousands of reactions, and the candidate was quick to recruit branding, marketing, frontend, and backend developers for the project. Heaps of praise all around. He listed himself as a Director of XXXX (redacted), the new name for his project. \n\nThe accuracy was based on a training dataset of ~30 images of lesion \/ healthy lungs, sharing of data between test \/ train \/ validation, and code to train ResNet50 from a PyTorch tutorial.   Nonetheless, thousands of reactions and praise from the \u201cAI | Data Science | Entrepreneur\u201d community. \n\n**Original Post:**\n\nI saw this post circulating on LinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/activity-6645711949554425856-9Dhm\n\nHere, a PhD candidate claims to achieve great performance with \u201cARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d to predict coronavirus, asks for more help, and garners tens of thousands of views. The repo housing this ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE solution already has a backend, front end, *branding*, a README translated in 6 languages, and a call to spread the word for this wonderful technology. Surely, I thought, this researcher has some great and novel tech for all of this hype? I mean dear god, we have *branding*, and the author has listed himself as the *founder of an organization* based on this project. Anything with this much attention, with dozens of \u201cAI | Data Scientist | Entrepreneur\u201d members of LinkedIn praising it, must have some great merit, right? \n\nLo and behold, we have ResNet50, from torchvision.models import resnet50, with its linear layer replaced. We have a training dataset of 30 images. This should\u2019ve taken at MAX 3 hours to put together - 1 hour for following a tutorial, and 2 for obfuscating the training with unnecessary code. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know what to think other than this is bonkers. I hope I\u2019m wrong, and there\u2019s some secret model this author is hiding? If so, I\u2019ll delete this post, but I looked through the repo and (REPO link redacted) that\u2019s all I could find. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss for thoughts. Can someone explain why this stuff trends on LinkedIn, gets thousands of views and reactions, and gets loads of praise from \u201cexpert data scientists\u201d? It\u2019s almost offensive to people who are like ... actually working to treat coronavirus and develop real solutions. It also seriously turns me off from pursuing an MS in CV as opposed to CS.\n\nEdit: It turns out there were duplicate images between test \/ val \/ training, as if ResNet50 on 30 images wasn\u2019t enough already. \n\nHe\u2019s also posted an update signed as \u201cDirector of XXXX (redacted)\u201d. This seems like a straight up sleazy way to capitalize on the pandemic by advertising himself to be the head of a made up organization, pulling resources away from real biomedical researchers.",

        "body":"TL;DR: The only thing worse than not providing code is saying you did and not following through.\n\nI'm frustrated, so this might be a little bit of a rant but here goes: I cannot believe that it is acceptable in highly ranked conferences to straight-up lie about the availability of code. Firstly, obviously it would be great if everyone released their code all the time because repeatability in ML is pretty dismal at times. But if you're not going to publish your code, then don't say you are. Especially when you're leaving details out of the paper and referring the reader to said \"published\" code.\n\nTake for example [this paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2004.04725), coming out of NVIDIA's research lab and published in CVPR2020. It is fairly detail-sparse, and nigh on impossible to reproduce in its current state as a result. It refers the reader to [this repository](https:\/\/github.com\/NVlabs\/wetectron) which has been a single readme since its creation. It is simply unacceptable for this when the paper directly says the code has been released.\n\nAs top conferences are starting to encourage the release of code, I think there needs to be another component: the code must actually be available. Papers that link to empty or missing repositories within some kind of reasonable timeframe of publication should be withdrawn. It should be unacceptable to direct readers to code that doesn't exist for details, and similarly for deleting repositories shortly after publication. I get that this is logistically a little tough, because it has to be done after publication, but still we can't let this be considered okay\n\nEDIT: To repeat the TL;DR again and highlight the key point - There won't always be code, that's frustrating but tolerable. There is no excuse for claiming to have code available, but not actually making it available. Code should be required to be up at time of publication, and kept up for some duration, if a paper wishes to claim to have released their code.",

Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*\n\n **Problem 1: training data contamination**\n\nTo benchmark GPT-4\u2019s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10\/10 pre-2021 problems and 0\/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set \u2014 or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can\u2019t recall.\n\nAs further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.\n\nIn fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation.",

The workshop is cancelled, and that\u2019s all,\u201d Guillaume Belanger, an astrophysicist and the INTEGRAL Science Operations Coordinator at the ESA, told The Register on Monday.\n\nRaval isn\u2019t about to quit his work any time soon, however. He promised students who graduated from his course that they would be referred to recruiters at Nvidia, Intel, Google and Amazon for engineering positions, or matched with a startup co-founder or a consulting client.\n\nIn an unlisted YouTube video recorded live for his students discussing week eight of his course, and seen by El Reg, he read out a question posed to him: \u201cWill your referrals hold any value now?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, yeah they\u2019re going to hold value. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t. I mean, yes, some people on Twitter were angry but that has nothing to do with\u2026 I mean\u2026 I\u2019ve also had tons of support, you know. I\u2019ve had tons of support from people, who, uh, you know, support me, who work at these companies.\n\n*He continues to justify his actions:*\n\n\u201cPublic figures called me in private to remind me that this happens. You know, people make mistakes. You just have to keep going. They\u2019re basically just telling me to not to stop. Of course, you make mistakes but you just keep going,\u201d he claimed.\n\n*When The Register asked Raval for comment, he responded:*\n\n**I've hardly taken any time off to relax since I first started my YouTube channel almost four years ago. And despite the enormous amount of work it takes to release two high quality videos a week for my audience, I progressively started to take on multiple other projects simultaneously by myself \u2013 a book, a docu-series, podcasts, YouTube videos, the course, the school of AI. Basically, these past few weeks, I've been experiencing a burnout unlike anything I've felt before. As a result, all of my output has been subpar.**\n\n**I made the [neural qubits] video and paper in one week. I remember wishing I had three to six months to really dive into quantum machine-learning and make something awesome, but telling myself I couldn't take that long as it would hinder my other projects. I plagiarized large chunks of the paper to meet my self-imposed one-week deadline. The associated video with animations took a lot more work to make. I didn't expect the paper to be cited as serious research, I considered it an additional reading resource for people who enjoyed the associated video to learn more about quantum machine learning. If I had a second chance, I'd definitely take way more time to write the paper, and in my own words.**\n\n**I've given refunds to every student who's asked so far, and the majority of students are still enrolled in the course. There are many happy students, they're just not as vocal on social media. We're on week 8 of 10 of my course, fully committed to student success.**\n\n\u201cAnd, no, I haven't plagiarized research for any other paper,\u201d he added.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2019\/10\/14\/ravel_ai_youtube\/",

        "body":"I was not going to post this but something wrong is happening here in this subreddit which forced my hands.\n\n\nThis week two posts relating to machine learning were posted here one is about [How visual search works](https:\/\/thomasdelteil.github.io\/VisualSearch_MXNet\/) and other about [generating ramen](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/8l5w56\/p_generative_ramen\/). The former post contains a small write up, source code and a demo site to explain how visual search works and the latter just have a gif of generated  ramen probably with a GAN. The irony is that the post which has more information and source code for reproducing that work got only about 25 votes and the one with gif only with no source code or explanation provided got more than 1000 votes (not so unique work any one with basic understanding of GAN can make one). Today the most upvoted post here is about [a circle generating GAN](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/8mgs8k\/p_visualisation_of_a_gan_learning_to_generate_a\/) which also has only a gif with brief explanation as comment and no source code. Are you seeing a pattern here?\n\nThe problem I mentioned above is not a one of case, I am a regular lurker in this subreddit and for the past few months I started seeing some disturbing patterns in posts posted here. People who posts gif\/movie\/photo only post tends to get more upvotes than the posts with full source code or explanation.  I agree some original research posts [such as this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44&feature=youtu.be&t=7s) or [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y__pYj9UHfc) can be only be released as videos and not the source code because of its commercial value. But most of the gif\/movie\/photo only posts here are not at all original research but they used a already know algorithm with a different dataset (eg: Ramen generation). \n\nThe problem here is If we continue this type of posts people will stop sharing their original works, source code or explanation and then starts sharing this type of end result only posts which will get less scrutiny and more votes. In future, this will not only decrease the quality of this subreddit but also its a greater danger to the open nature of Machine learning field. What's the point in posting a github project link or blogpost here when we can get much more votes with a gif alone?.\n\n*I am not a academician but I use r\/MachineLearning to find blogs, articles and projects which explains\/program recent discoveries in AI which then I myself can try out.*\n",

The fact that this work is being legitimized with a peer reviewed stamp of approval makes me wonder when the first ML phrenology paper will surface.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think the important takeaway is understanding the differing definitions of bias. The letter makes it clear that the authors claim to \u201cpredict if someone is a criminal based solely on a picture of their face,\u201d with \u201c80 percent accuracy and with no racial bias.\u201d The problem being that by using the phrase \u201cno racial bias\u201d they are conflating the issue of algorithmic bias with the societal notion of bias. The letter spells out the societal aspect quite well:\n\n> Let\u2019s be clear: there is no way to develop a system that can predict or identify \u201ccriminality\u201d that is not racially biased \u2014 because the category of \u201ccriminality\u201d itself is racially biased.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaybe we have a terminology issue that we as an ML community need to address so we can better convey the distinction between algorithmic bias (which may or may not be desirable depending on the desired result) versus the societal notion of bias, which can be codified in the datasets we use.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyway, despite the length of the letter, I think it\u2019s an important read as it clearly elucidates a number of the issues that have been discussed around fairness in ML. I also urge people to sign the petition and email Springer Nature your concerns if you feel so inclined.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Looks like the petition worked pretty quickly. Springer Nature isn\u2019t going to publish the paper, though I would still urge people to read the linked letter (and the excellent footnotes) and potentially still show solidarity by signing the petition.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/SpringerNature\/status\/1275477365196566528",

Please!\n\nStop submitting unfinished work to conferences.\n\nAt this point more than half of the papers I'm reviewing are clearly unfinished work. They have significant, unmistakable flaws to the point that no reasonable person can believe that this work could possibly appear in a peer reviewed, top tier conference. No reasonable person can put these submitted papers next to even the worst ICML paper from the last few years, and believe that yeah, they're of similar or higher quality.\n\nPlease take the time to get your work reviewed by your peers, or even your advisor prior to submission. If they can find \\*any\\* flaw in your work, I assure you, your reviewers are going to find so many flaws and give you a hurtful, and demoralizing review.\n\nI realize that we're all in a huge hype bubble, and we all want to ride the hype train, but reviewing these unfinished works makes me feel so disrespected by the authors. They're clearly submitting for early feedback. It's not fair to the conference system and the peer review process to ask your reviewers to do \\*unpaid\\* research work for you and advise you on how to construct and present your work. It's not fair to treat your reviewers as free labor.\n\nIt takes me at a \\*minimum\\* 6-7 hours to review one paper, and more likely 10+ hours. That's 10+ hours of my life that these authors think is entitled to them to help them in their research so they can get published. It makes me feel so disrespected, and quite honestly, makes me want to give up on signing up as a reviewer if this is the quality of work I am expected to review.\n\nNot only are these authors being selfish, but they're hurting the overall research community, conference quality, and the peer review process. More unfinished work being submitted, means reviewers have a higher workload. We don't get to spend as much time on each paper as we would like to, meaning \\*good well written deserving papers\\* either get overlooked, unfairly rejected, or get terrible feedback. This is simply unacceptable!\n\nThese authors, quite honestly, are acting like those people who hoard toilet paper during an epidemic. They act selfishly to the detriment of the community, putting themselves above both the research process, and other authors who submit good work.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't do this. Submit finished, good work, that you think is ready for publication and peer review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold award kind stranger. You make me feel a little better about my week.\n\nEdit2: Thanks for the platinum. Thanks for the support\/discussion guys.\n\n&#x200B;",

The theory of ODE is extremely deep (read tomes such as the one by Philip Hartman), but this paper seems to take a short cut to all I've learned about it. Have no idea what this paper is talking about after 2 years. Looked on Reddit, a bunch of people also don't understand and have came up with various extremely bizarre interpretations.\n* **ADAM:** this is a shameful confession because I never understood anything beyond the ADAM equations. There are stuff in the paper such as  signal-to-noise ratio, regret bounds, regret proof, and even another algorithm called AdaMax hidden in the paper. Never understood any of it. Don't know the theoretical implications.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are other papers out there.

        "body":"Google has some serious cultural problems with proper credit assignment. They continue to rename methods discovered earlier DESPITE admitting the existence of this work.\n\nSee this new paper they released:\n\n[https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.14536](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2006.14536)\n\nStop calling this method SWISH; its original name is SILU. The original Swish authors from Google even admitted to this mistake in the past ([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/773epu\/r\\_swish\\_a\\_selfgated\\_activation\\_function\\_google\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/773epu\/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google\/)). And the worst part is this new paper has the very same senior author as the previous Google paper.\n\nAnd just a couple weeks ago, the same issue again with the SimCLR paper. See thread here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/hbzd5o\/d\\_on\\_the\\_public\\_advertising\\_of\\_neurips\/fvcet9j\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/hbzd5o\/d_on_the_public_advertising_of_neurips\/fvcet9j\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThey site only cite prior work with the same idea in the last paragraph of their supplementary and yet again rename the method to remove its association to the prior work. This is unfair. Unfair to the community and especially unfair to the lesser known researchers who do not have the advertising power of Geoff Hinton and Quoc Le on their papers.\n\nSiLU\/Swish is by Stefan Elfwing, Eiji Uchibe, Kenji Doya ([https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1702.03118](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1702.03118)).\n\nOriginal work of SimCLR is by Mang Ye, Xu Zhang, Pong C. Yuen, Shih-Fu Chang ([https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1904.03436](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1904.03436))\n\nUpdate:\n\nDan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel also proposed the SiLU non-linearity in 2016 in their work Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) ([https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1606.08415](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1606.08415))\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n\"Smooth Adversarial Training\" by Cihang Xie is only an example of the renaming issue because of issues in the past by Google to properly assign credit. Cihang Xie's work is not the cause of this issue. Their paper does not claim to discover a new activation function. They are only using the SiLU activation function in some of their experiments under the name Swish. [Cihang Xie will provide an update of the activation function naming used in the paper](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/hkiyir\/r\\_google\\_has\\_a\\_credit\\_assignment\\_problem\\_in\/fwtttqo?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x) to reflect the correct naming. \n\nThe cause of the issue is Google in the past decided to continue with renaming the activation as [Swish despite being made aware of the method already having the name SiLU](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1710.05941). Now it is stuck in our research community and stuck in our ML libraries (https:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/tensorflow\/issues\/41066).",

        "body":"I was watching the GTC keynote and became entirely overwhelmed by the amount of progress achieved from last year.  I'm wondering how everyone else feels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3\/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlphaSignalAI\/status\/1638235815137386508](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlphaSignalAI\/status\/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with \"new ideas, that set us apart\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWatching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop \"disruptive products and business models\". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?",

        "body":"TL;DR for those who dont want to read the full rant. \n\nSpent hours performing feature selection,data preprocessing, pipeline building, choosing a model that gives decent results on all metrics and extensive testing only to lose to someone who used a model that was clearly overfitting on a dataset that was clearly broken, all because the other team was using \"deep learning\". Are buzzwords all that matter to execs?\n\n\n\nI've been learning Machine Learning for the past 2 years now. Most of my experience has been with Deep Learning. \n\nRecently, I participated in a Hackathon. The Problem statement my team picked was \"Anomaly detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning\/Deep Learning\". Us being mostly a DL shop, thats the first approach we tried. We found an open source dataset about cyber attacks on servers, lo and behold, we had a val accuracy of 99.8 in a single epoch of a simple feed forward net, with absolutely zero data engineering....which was way too good to be true. Upon some more EDA and some googling we found two things, one, three of the features had a correlation of more than 0.9 with the labels, which explained the ridiculous accuracy, and two, the dataset we were using had been repeatedly criticized since it's publication for being completely unlike actual data found in network traffic. This thing (the name of the dataset is kddcup99, for those interested ) was really old (published in 1999) and entirely synthetic. The people who made it completely fucked up and ended up producing a dataset that was almost linear. \n\nTo top it all off, we could find no way to extract over half of the features listed in that dataset, from real time traffic, meaning a model trained on this data could never be put into production, since there was no way to extract the correct features from the incoming data during inference.\n\nWe spent the next hour searching for a better source of data, even trying out unsupervised approaches like auto encoders, finally settling on a newer, more robust dataset, generated from real data (titled UNSW-NB15, published 2015, not the most recent my InfoSec standards, but its the best we could find). \nCue almost 18 straight, sleepless hours of determining feature importance, engineering and structuring the data (for eg. we had to come up with our own solutions to representing IP addresses and port numbers, since encoding either through traditional approaches like one-hot was just not possible), iterating through different models,finding out where the model was messing up, and preprocessing data to counter that, setting up pipelines for taking data captures in raw pcap format, converting them into something that could be fed to the model, testing out the model one random pcap files found around the internet, simulating both postive and negative conditions (we ran port scanning attacks on our own machines and fed the data of the network traffic captured during the attack to the model), making sure the model was behaving as expected with a balanced accuracy, recall and f1_score, and after all this we finally built a web interface where the user could actually monitor their network traffic and be alerted if there were any anomalies detected, getting a full report of what kind of anomaly, from what IP, at what time, etc. \n\nAfter all this we finally settled on using a RandomForestClassifier, because the DL approaches we tried kept messing up because of the highly skewed data (good accuracy, shit recall) whereas randomforests did a far better job handling that. We had a respectable 98.8 Acc on the test set, and similar recall value of 97.6. We didn't know how the other teams had done but we were satisfied with our work. \n\nDuring the judging round, after 15 minutes of explaining all of the above to them, the only question the dude asked us was \"so you said you used a nueral network with 99.8 Accuracy, is that what your final result is based on?\". We then had to once again explain why that 99.8 accuracy was absolutely worthless, considering the data itself was worthless and how Neural Nets hadn't shown themselves to be very good at handling data imbalance (which is important considering the fact that only a tiny percentage of all network traffic is anomalous). The judge just muttered \"so its not a Neural net\", to himself, and walked away. \n\nWe lost the competetion, but I was genuinely excited to know what approach the winning team took until i asked them, and found out ....they used a fucking neural net on kddcup99 and that was all that was needed. Is that all that mattered to the dude? That they used \"deep learning\". What infuriated me even more was this team hadn't done anything at all with the data, they had no fucking clue that it was broken, and when i asked them if they had used a supervised feed forward net or unsupervised autoencoders, the dude looked at me as if I was talking in Latin....so i didnt even lose to a team using deep learning , I lost to one pretending to use deep learning. \n\nI know i just sound like a salty loser but it's just incomprehensible to me. The judge was a representative of a startup that very proudly used \"Machine Learning to enhance their Cyber Security Solutions, to provide their users with the right security for todays multi cloud environment\"....and they picked a solution with horrible recall, tested on an unreliable dataset, that could never be put into production over everything else ( there were two more teams thay used approaches similar to ours but with slightly different preprocessing and final accuracy metrics). But none of that mattered...they judged entirely based on two words. Deep. Learning. Does having actual knowledge of Machine Learning and Datascience actually matter or should I just bombard people with every buzzword I know to get ahead in life.",

Here is a quick summary and you can also check out the [original blog](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/data-science-is-boring-1d43473e353e) he wrote.\n\n[**1.

Try to cope with the frustration and boringness, and \"enjoy the small reward along the way and the final victory\".\n\n (I'd agree with most of his thoughts. In fact, this is a common reality for most research deployments. Any thoughts or experience?)",

I took a thesis track in my degree because as an immigrant it's harder to get into a good research lab without having authorship in a couple of good papers  (Or so I delude myself ). \n\nI worked as a Full-stack SWE for a startup for 4+ years before coming to the US for a master\u2019s degree focused on ML and AI. I did everything in those years. From project management to building fully polished S\/W products to DevOps to even dabbled in ML. I did my Batchelor\u2019s degree from a university whose name is not even worth mentioning. The university for my master\u2019s degree is in the top 20 in the AI space.  I didn't know much about ML and the curiosity drove me to university.  \n\nCome to uni and I focused on learning ML and AI for one 1-1.5 years after which I found advisors for a thesis topic. This is when the fun starts. I had the most amazing advisors but the entire peer review system and the way we assess ML\/Science is what ticked me off. This is where the rant begins. \n\n# Rant 1:Acadmia follows a Gated Institutional Narrative\n\nLet's say you are a Ph.D. at the world's top AI institution working under the best prof. You have a way higher likelihood of you getting a good Postdoc at a huge research lab vs someone's from my poor country doing a Ph.D. with a not-so-well-known advisor having published not-so-well-known papers. I come from a developing nation and I see this many times here. In my country academics don't get funding as they do at colleges in the US. One of the reasons for this is that colleges don't have such huge endowments and many academics don't have wealthy research sponsors.  Brand names and prestige carry massive weight to help get funding in US academic circles. This prestige\/money percolates down to the students and the researchers who work there. Students in top colleges get a huge advantage and the circles of top researchers keep being from the same sets of institutions. I have nothing against top researchers from top institutions but due to the nature of citations and the way the money flows based on them, a vicious cycle is created where the best institutions keep getting better and the rest don't get as much of a notice. \n\n# Rant 2: Peer Review without Code Review in ML\/AI is shady \n\nI am a computer scientist and I was appalled when I heard that you don't need to do code reviews for research papers. As a computer scientist and someone who actually did shit tons of actual ML in the past year, I find it absolutely garbage that code reviews are not a part of this system. I am not saying every scientist who reads a paper should review code but at least one person should for any paper's code submission. At least in ML and AI space. This is basic. I don't get why people call themselves computer scientists if they don't want to read the fucking code. If you can't then make a grad student do it. But for the collective of science, we need this.  \n\n***The core problem lies in the fact that peer review is free. :*** There should be better solutions for this. We ended up creating Git and that changed so many lives. Academic Research needs something similar.\n\n# Rant 3: My Idea is Novel Until I see Someone Else's Paper\n\nThe volume of scientific research is growing exponentially. Information is being created faster than we can digest.  We can't expect people to know everything and the amount of overlap in the AI\/ML fields requires way better search engines than Google Scholar. \n\nThe side effect of large volumes of research is that every paper is doing something \"novel\" making it harder to filter what the fuck was novel. \n\nI have had so many experiences where I coded up something and came to realize that someone else has done something symbolically similar and my work just seems like a small variant of that. That's what fucks with my head. Is what I did in Novel? What the fuck is Novel? Is stitching up a transformer to any problem with fancy embeddings and tidying it up as a research paper Novel? Is just making a transformer bigger Novel?  Is some new RL algorithm tested with 5 seeds and some fancy fucking prior and some esoteric reasoning for its success Novel? Is using an over parameterized model to get 95% accuracy on 200 sample test set Novel? Is apply Self-supervised learning for some new dataset Novel? If I keep on listing questions on novelty, I can probably write a novel asking about what the fuck is \"Novel\". \n\n# Rant 4: Citation Based Optimization Promotes Self Growth Over Collective Growth\n\nWhatever people may say about collaboration, Academia intrinsically doesn't promote the right incentive structures to harbor collaboration. Let me explain, When you write a paper, the position of your name matters. If you are just a Ph.D. student and a first author to a paper, it's great. If you are an nth author Not so great. Apparently, this is a very touchy thing for academics. And lots of egos can clash around numbering and ordering of names.  I distinctly remember once attending some seminar in a lab and approaching a few students on research project ideas. The first thing that came out of the PhD student's mouth was the position in authorship. As an engineer who worked with teams in the past, this was never something I had thought about. Especially because I worked in industry, where it's always the group over the person. Academia is the reverse. Academia applauds the celebration of the individual's achievements. \n\nAll of this is understandable but it's something I don't like. This makes PhDs stick to their lane. The way citations\/research-focus calibrate the \"hire-ability\" and \"completion of Ph.D. thesis\" metrics, people are incentivized to think about themselves instead of thinking about collaborations for making something better. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nA Ph.D. in its most idealistic sense for me is the pursuit of hard ideas(I am poetic that way). In a situation like now when you have to publish or perish and words on paper get passed off as science without even seeing the code that runs it, I am extremely discouraged to go down that route.  All these rants are not to diss on scientists. I did them because \"we\" as a community need better ways to addressing some of these problems.\n\n\nP.S.\nNever expected so many people to express their opinions about this rant. \n\nU shouldn\u2019t take this seriously. As many people have stated I am an outsider with tiny experience to give a full picture.\n\nI realize that my post as coming out as something which tries to dichotomize academia and industry. I am not trying to do that. I wanted to highlight some problems I saw for which there is no one person to blame. These issues are in my opinion a byproduct of the economics which created this system. \n\nThank you for gold stranger.",

It\u2019s a translation system that can support over 200 languages, even if there isn't a lot of text available to learn from. \u00a0 The reality is that a handful of languages dominate the web meaning only a fraction of the world can access content and contribute to the web in their own language. We want to change this by creating more inclusive machine translations systems \u2013 ones that unlock access to the web for the more than 4B people around the world that are currently excluded because they do not speak one of the few languages content is available in. \u00a0 Here are a few things about NLLB we\u2019re excited for:\n\n* Latest breakthrough:\u00a0we created a single model that translates over 200 different languages with state-of-the-art results.\n* Billions of translations:\u00a0We\u2019re applying the techniques from the research advancements from NLLB to support more than 25 billion translations served every day on Facebook News Feed, Instagram, and our other platforms.\n* Meta\u2019s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC):\u00a0This large-scale conditional language model is one of the first AI models trained on Meta\u2019s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer.\n* Open sourcing:\u00a0By open sourcing our model and publishing a slew of research tools, we hope that AI researchers whose languages are not supported well or at all on commercial translations services could use our model to create support for that language. Furthermore, we\u2019ve open sourced datasets, such as NLLB-Seed and\u00a0FLORES-200\u00a0evaluation benchmark, which doubles the existing language coverage over our previous benchmark.\n* Wikimedia Foundation collaboration:\u00a0We collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation to help improve translation systems on their Content Translations tool. Editors can now more efficiently translate and edit articles in 20  low-resource languages, including 10 that previously were not supported by any machine translation tools on the platform.\u00a0\n* Books translation:\u00a0we\u2019re partnering with local publishers around the world to translate children\u2019s stories.\n\nYou can check out some of our materials and open sourced artifacts here:\u00a0\n\n* Our latest blog post:\u00a0[https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/blog\/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation](https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/blog\/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation)\n* Project Overview:\u00a0[https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/research\/no-language-left-behind\/\u00a0](https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/research\/no-language-left-behind\/\u00a0)\n* Product demo:\u00a0[https:\/\/nllb.metademolab.com\/](https:\/\/nllb.metademolab.com\/)\n* Research paper:\u00a0[https:\/\/research.facebook.com\/publications\/no-language-left-behind](https:\/\/research.facebook.com\/publications\/no-language-left-behind)\n* NLLB-200:\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/fairseq\/tree\/nllb](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/fairseq\/tree\/nllb)\n* FLORES-200:\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/flores](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/flores)\n* LASER3:\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/LASER](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/LASER) \u00a0\n\nJoining us today for the AMA are:\n\n* Angela Fan (AF), Research Scientist\u00a0\n* Jean Maillard (JM), Research Scientist\n* Maha Elbayad (ME), Research Scientist\n* Philipp Koehn (PK), Research Scientist\n* Shruti Bhosale (SB), Software Engineer \u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll be here from 07\/21\/2022 @09:00AM PT - 10:00AM PT\u00a0\n\nThanks and we\u2019re looking forward to answering your questions!\n\n**EDIT 10:30am PT:** Thanks for all the questions, we\u2019re signing off!

RAM usage was also reduced heavily.\n* **Their breakthrough isn't device-specific; rather it's a generalized approach that can add improvements to all latent diffusion models.** Overall image generation time decreased by 52% and 33% on a Samsung S23 Ultra and an iPhone 14 Pro, respectively.\n*  Running generative AI locally on a phone, without a data connection or a cloud server, opens up a host of possibilities.

        "body":"TD;LR: At Company A, Team X does advanced analytics using on-prem ERP tools and older programming languages. Their tools work very well and are designed based on very deep business and domain expertise. Team Y is a new and ambitious Data Science team that thinks they can replace Team X's tools with a bunch of R scripts and a custom built ML platform. Their models are simplistic, but more \"fashionable\" compared to the econometric models used by Team X, and team Y benefits from the ML\/DS moniker so leadership is allowing Team Y to start a large scale overhaul of the analytics platform in question. Team Y doesn't have the experience for such a larger scale transformation, and is refusing to collaborate with team X. This project is very likely going to fail, and cause serious harm to the company as a whole financially and from a people perspective. I argue that this is not just because of bad leadership, but also because of various trends and mindsets in the DS community at large. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate (Jump to below the line for the original story): \n\nSeveral people in the comments are pointing out that this just a management failure, not something due to ML\/DS, and that you can replace DS with any buzz tech and the story will still be relevant. \n\nMy response: \nOf course, any failure at an organization level is ultimately a management failure one way or the other. \nMoreover, it is also the case that ML\/DS when done correctly, will always improve a company's bottom line. There is no scenario where the proper ML solution, delivered at a reasonable cost and in a timely fashion, will somehow hurt the company's bottom line.\n\nMy point is that in this case management is failing because of certain trends and practices that are specific to the ML\/DS community, namely: \n* The idea that DS teams should operate independently of tech and business orgs -- too much autonomy for DS teams \n* The disregard for domain knowledge that seems prevalent nowadays  thanks to the ML hype, that DS can be generalists and someone with good enough ML chops can solve any business problem.  That wasn't the case when I first left academia for the industry in 2009  (back then nobody would even bother with a phone screen if you didn't have the right domain knowledge). \n* Over reliance on resources who check all the ML hype related boxes (knows Python, R, Tensorflow, Shiny, etc..., has the right Coursera certifications, has blogged on the topic, etc...), but are lacking in depth of  experience. DS interviews nowadays all seem to be: Can you tell me what a p-value is? What is elastic net regression? Show me how to fit a model in sklearn? How do you impute NAs in an R dataframe? Any smart person can look those up on Stackoverflow or Cross-Validated,.....Instead teams should be asking stuff like: why does portfolio optimization use QP not LP? How does a forecast influence a customer service level? When should a recommendation engine be content based and when should it use collaborative filtering? etc...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(This is a true story, happening to the company I currently work for. Names, domains, algorithms, and roles have been shuffled around to protect my anonymity)*\u00a0\n\nCompany A has been around for several decades. It is not the biggest name in its domain, but it is a well respected one.\u00a0Risk analysis and portfolio optimization have been a core of Company A's business since the 90s. They have a large team of 30 or so analysts who perform those tasks on a daily basis. These analysts use ERP solutions implemented for them by one the big ERP companies (SAP, Teradata, Oracle, JD Edwards,...) or one of the major tech consulting companies (Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, Capgemini, etc...) in collaboration with their own in house engineering team. The tools used are embarrassingly old school: Classic RDBMS running on on-prem servers or maybe even on mainframes, code written in COBOL, Fortran, weird proprietary stuff like ABAP or SPSS.....you get the picture. But the models and analytic functions were pretty sophisticated, and surprisingly cutting edge compared to the published academic literature. Most of all, they fit well with the company's enterprise ecosystem, and were honed based on years of deep domain knowledge.\u00a0\n\nThey have a tech team of several engineers (poached from the aforementioned software and consulting companies) and product managers (who came from the experienced pools of analysts and managers who use the software, or poached from business rivals) maintaining and running this software. Their technology might be old school, but collectively, they know the domain and the company's overall architecture very, very well. They've guided the company through several large scale upgrades and migrations and they have a track record of delivering on time, without too much overhead. The few times they've stumbled, they knew how to pick themselves up very quickly.\u00a0In fact within their industry niche, they have a reputation for their expertise, and have very good relations with the various vendors they've had to deal with. They were the launching pad of several successful ERP consulting careers.\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, despite dealing on a daily basis with statistical modeling and optimization algorithms, none of the analysts, engineers, or product managers involved describe themselves as data scientists or machine learning experts.\u00a0It is mostly a cultural thing: Their expertise predates the Data Science\/ML hype that started circa 2010, and they got most of their chops using proprietary enterprise tools instead of the open source tools popular nowadays.\u00a0A few of them have formal statistical training, but most of them came from engineering or domain backgrounds and learned stats on the fly while doing their job. Call this team \"Team X\".\u00a0\n\nSometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done?\u00a0Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team \"Y\" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team \"Y\" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role. All of them were very bright people, they could write great Medium blog posts and give inspiring TED talks, but collectively they had very little real world industry experience. \n\nAs is the fashion nowadays, this group was made part of a data science org that reported directly to the CEO and Board, bypassing the CIO and any tech or business VPs, since Company A wanted to claim the monikers \"data driven\" and \"AI powered\" in their upcoming shareholder meetings.\u00a0In 3 or 4 years of existence, team Y produced a few Python and R scripts. Their architectural experience \u00a0consisted almost entirely in connecting Flask to S3 buckets or Redshift tables, with a couple of the more resourceful ones learning how to plug their models into Tableau or how to spin up a Kuberneties pod.\u00a0 But they needn't worry: The aforementioned manager, who was now a director (and was also doing an online Masters to make up for his qualifications gap and bolster his chances of becoming VP soon - at least he now understands what L1 regularization is), was a master at playing corporate politics and self-promotion. No matter how few actionable insights team Y produced or how little code they deployed to production, he always had their back and made sure they had ample funding. In fact he now had grandiose plans for setting up an all-purpose machine learning platform that can be used to solve all of the company's data problems.\u00a0\n\nA couple of sharp minded members of team Y, upon googling their industry name along with the word \"data science\", realized that risk analysis was a prime candidate for being solved with Bayesian models, and there was already a nifty R package for doing just that, whose tutorial they went through on R-Bloggers.com. One of them had even submitted a Bayesian classifier Kernel for a competition on Kaggle (he was 203rd on the leaderboard), and was eager to put his new-found expertise to use on a real world problem.\u00a0They pitched the idea to their director, who saw a perfect use case for his upcoming ML platform. They started work on it immediately, without bothering to check whether anybody at Company A was already doing risk analysis. Since their org was independent, they didn't really need to check with anybody else before they got funding for their initiative. Although it was basically a Naive Bayes classifier, the term ML was added to the project tile, to impress the board.\u00a0\n\nAs they progressed with their work however, tensions started to build. They had asked the data warehousing and CA analytics teams to build pipelines for them, and word eventually got out to team X about their project. Team X was initially thrilled: They offered to collaborate whole heartedly, and would have loved to add an ML based feather to their already impressive cap. The product owners and analysts were totally onboard as well: They saw a chance to get in on the whole Data Science hype that they kept hearing about. But through some weird mix of arrogance and insecurity, team Y refused to collaborate with them or share any of their long term goals with them, even as they went to other parts of the company giving brown bag presentations and tutorials on the new model they created.\u00a0\n\nTeam X got resentful: from what they saw of team Y's model, their approach was hopelessly naive and had little chances of scaling or being sustainable in production, and they knew exactly how to help with that. Deploying the model to production would have taken them a few days, given how comfortable they were with DevOps and continuous delivery (team Y had taken several months to figure out how to deploy a simple R script to production). And despite how old school their own tech was, team X were crafty enough to be able to plug it in to their existing architecture. Moreover, the output of the model was such that it didn't take into account how the business will consume it or how it was going to be fed to downstream systems, and the product owners could have gone a long way in making the model more amenable to adoption by the business stakeholders.\u00a0But team Y wouldn't listen, and their leads brushed off any attempts at communication, let alone collaboration. The vibe that team Y was giving off was \"We are the cutting edge ML team, you guys are the legacy server grunts. We don't need your opinion.\", and they seemed to have a complete disregard for domain knowledge, or worse, they thought that all that domain knowledge consisted of was being able to grasp the definitions of a few business metrics.\u00a0\n\nTeam X got frustrated and tried to express their concerns to leadership. But despite owning a vital link in Company A's business process, they were only \\~50 people in a large 1000 strong technology and operations org, and they were several layers removed from the C-suite, so it was impossible for them to get their voices heard.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the unstoppable director was doing what he did best: Playing corporate politics. Despite how little his team had actually delivered, he had convinced the board that all analysis and optimization tasks should now be migrated to his yet to be delivered ML platform. Since most leaders now knew that there was overlap between team Y and team X's objectives, his pitch was no longer that team Y was going to create a new insight, but that they were going to replace (or modernize) the legacy statistics based on-prem tools with more accurate cloud based ML tools. Never mind that there was no support in the academic literature for the idea that Naive Bayes works better than the Econometric approaches used by team X, let alone the additional wacky idea that Bayesian Optimization would definitely outperform the QP solvers that were running in production.\u00a0\n\nUnbeknownst to team X, the original Bayesian risk analysis project has now grown into a multimillion dollar major overhaul initiative, which included the eventual replacement of all of the tools and functions supported by team X along with the necessary migration to the cloud. The CIO and a couple of business VPs are on now board, and tech leadership is treating it as a done deal.\n\nAn outside vendor, a startup who nobody had heard of, was contracted to help build the platform, since team Y has no engineering skills. The choice was deliberate, as calling on any of the established consulting or software companies would have eventually led leadership to the conclusion that team X was better suited for a transformation on this scale than team Y.\u00a0\n\nTeam Y has no experience with any major ERP deployments, and no domain knowledge, yet they are being tasked with fundamentally changing the business process that is at the core of Company A's business. Their models actually perform worse than those deployed by team X, and their architecture is hopelessly simplistic, compared to what is necessary for running such a solution in production.\u00a0\n\nIronically, using Bayesian thinking and based on all the evidence, the likelihood that team Y succeeds is close to 0%. \n\nAt best, the project is going to end up being a write off of 50 million dollars or more. Once the !@#$!@# hits the fan, a couple of executive heads are going to role, and dozens of people will get laid off.\n\nAt worst, given how vital risk analysis and portfolio optimization is to Company A's revenue stream, the failure will eventually sink the whole company. It probably won't go bankrupt, but it will lose a significant portion of its business and work force.\u00a0Failed ERP implementations can and do sink large companies: Just see what happened to National Grid US, SuperValu or Target Canada.\u00a0\n\nOne might argue that this is more about corporate disfunction and bad leadership than about data science and AI. \n\nBut I disagree. I think the core driver of this debacle is indeed the blind faith in Data Scientists, ML models and the promise of AI, and the overall culture of hype and self promotion that is very common among the ML crowd.\u00a0\n\nWe haven't seen the end of this story: I sincerely hope that this ends well for the sake of my colleagues and all involved. Company A is a good company, and both its customers and its employees deserver better. But the chances of that happening are negligible given all the information available, and this failure will hit my company hard.\u00a0",

        "body":"*Recently, I saw a [post](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8) by [Rajiv Shah](https:\/\/twitter.com\/rajcs4), Chicago-based data-scientist, regarding an article published in Nature last year called [Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-018-0438-y), written by scientists at Harvard in collaboration with Google. Below is the article:*\n\n**Stand Up for Best Practices:\nMisuse of Deep Learning in Nature\u2019s Earthquake Aftershock Paper**\n\n**The Dangers of Machine Learning Hype**\n\nPractitioners of AI, machine learning, predictive modeling, and data science have grown enormously over the last few years. What was once a niche field defined by its blend of knowledge is becoming a rapidly growing profession. As the excitement around AI continues to grow, the new wave of ML augmentation, automation, and GUI tools will lead to even more growth in the number of people trying to build predictive models.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: While it becomes easier to use the tools of predictive modeling, predictive modeling knowledge is not yet a widespread commodity. Errors can be counterintuitive and subtle, and they can easily lead you to the wrong conclusions if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nI\u2019m a data scientist who works with dozens of expert data science teams for a living. In my day job, I see these teams striving to build high-quality models. The best teams work together to review their models to detect problems. There are many hard-to-detect-ways that lead to problematic models (say, by allowing target leakage into their training data).\n\nIdentifying issues is not fun. This requires admitting that exciting results are \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d or that their methods were not the right approach. In other words, *it\u2019s less about the sexy data science hype that gets headlines and more about a rigorous scientific discipline.*\n\n**Bad Methods Create Bad Results**\n\nAlmost a year ago, I read an [article](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-018-0438-y) in Nature that claimed unprecedented accuracy in predicting earthquake aftershocks by using deep learning. Reading the article, my internal radar became deeply suspicious of their results. *Their methods simply didn\u2019t carry many of the hallmarks of careful predicting modeling.*\n\nI started to dig deeper. In the meantime, this article blew up and became [widely recognized](https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/ai\/forecasting-earthquake-aftershock-locations-ai-assisted-science\/)! It was even included in the [release notes](https:\/\/medium.com\/tensorflow\/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8) for Tensorflow as an example of what deep learning could do. However, in my digging, I found major flaws in the paper. Namely, data leakage which leads to unrealistic accuracy scores and a lack of attention to model selection (you don\u2019t build a 6 layer neural network when a simpler model provides the same level of accuracy).\n\nTo my earlier point: these are subtle, but *incredibly basic* predictive modeling errors that can invalidate the entire results of an experiment. Data scientists are trained to recognize and avoid these issues in their work. I assumed that this was simply overlooked by the author, so I contacted her and let her know so that she could improve her analysis. Although we had previously communicated, she did not respond to my email over concerns with the paper.\n\n**Falling On Deaf Ears**\n\nSo, what was I to do? My coworkers told me to just [tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/rajcs4\/status\/1143236424738775046) [it](https:\/\/twitter.com\/DataScienceLA\/status\/1143245342785228800) and let it go, but I wanted to stand up for good modeling practices. I thought reason and best practices would prevail, so I started a 6-month process of writing up my results and shared them with Nature.\nUpon sharing my results, I received a note from Nature in January 2019 that despite serious concerns about data leakage and model selection that invalidate their experiment, they saw no need to correct the errors, because \u201c**Devries et al. are concerned primarily with using machine learning as [a] tool to extract insight into the natural world, and not with details of the algorithm design**.\u201d The authors provided a much [harsher](https:\/\/github.com\/rajshah4\/aftershocks_issues\/blob\/master\/correspondence\/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf) response.\n\nYou can read the entire exchange on my [github](https:\/\/github.com\/rajshah4\/aftershocks_issues).\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to say that I was disappointed. This was a major paper (it\u2019s **Nature**!) that bought into AI hype and published a paper despite it using flawed methods.\n\nThen, just this week, I ran [across](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-030-20521-8_1) [articles](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1904.01983) by Arnaud Mignan and Marco Broccardo on shortcomings that they found in the aftershocks article. Here are two more data scientists with expertise in earthquake analysis who also noticed flaws in the paper. I also have placed my analysis and reproducible code on [github](https:\/\/github.com\/rajshah4\/aftershocks_issues).\n\n**Standing Up For Predictive Modeling Methods**\n\nI want to make it clear: my goal is not to villainize the authors of the aftershocks paper. I don\u2019t believe that they were malicious, and I think that they would argue their goal was to just show how machine learning could be applied to aftershocks. Devries is an accomplished earthquake scientist who wanted to use the latest methods for her field of study and found exciting results from it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: their insights and results were based on fundamentally flawed methods. It\u2019s not enough to say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a machine learning paper, it\u2019s an earthquake paper.\u201d If you use predictive modeling, then the quality of your results are determined by the quality of your modeling. Your work becomes data science work, and you are on the hook for your scientific rigor.\n\nThere is a huge appetite for papers that use the latest technologies and approaches. It becomes very difficult to push back on these papers.\n\nBut if we allow papers or projects with fundamental issues to advance, it hurts all of us. It undermines the field of predictive modeling.\n\nPlease push back on bad data science. Report bad findings to papers. And if they don\u2019t take action, go to twitter, post about it, share your results and make noise. This type of collective action worked to raise awareness of p-values and combat the epidemic of p-hacking. We need good machine learning practices if we want our field to continue to grow and maintain credibility.\n\n[Link to Rajiv's Article](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8)\n\n[Original Nature Publication](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-018-0438-y) (note: paywalled)\n\n[GitHub repo contains an attempt to reproduce Nature's paper](https:\/\/github.com\/rajshah4\/aftershocks_issues)\n\n[Confrontational correspondence with authors](https:\/\/github.com\/rajshah4\/aftershocks_issues\/blob\/master\/correspondence\/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf)",

        "body":"I am a masters student and I have been doing ML research from a few years. I have a few top tier publications as well. Lately, I seem to have lost interest in research. I feel most of my collaborators (including my advisors) are mostly running after papers and don't seem to have interest in doing interesting off-the-track things. Ultimately, research has just become chasing one deadline after another. Another thing that bugs me is that most of the research (including mine) is not very useful. Even if I get some citations, I feel that it is highly unlikely that the work I am doing will ever be used by the general public. Earlier, I was very excited about PhD, but now I think it will be worthless pursuit. Is what I feel valid? How do I deal with these feelings and rejuvenate my interest in research? Or should I switch to something else - maybe applied ML?",

        "body":"I have a confession to make.\n\nI was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs\/decision tree\/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today.\n\nI joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that I\u2019m in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. What\u2019s worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably don\u2019t look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math\/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career.\n\nFor example, I\u2019ve never heard of the term \u201cLipschitz\u201d or \u201cWasserstein distance\u201d before, so I\u2019m unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1606.00709.pdf), and SeLU (https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1706.02515.pdf). I don\u2019t have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The \u201cNormalizing Flow\u201d (https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1505.05770.pdf) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation) \u2026 each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I don\u2019t even know where to start wrapping my head around. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesn\u2019t work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. It\u2019s an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but \u2026 \n\n* reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I can\u2019t just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldn\u2019t be happy.\n* but if I don\u2019t read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle. \n* the \u201cutility density\u201d of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I don\u2019t have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge *might* be useful *some day*, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again. \n* in the ideal world, I can query an **oracle** with \u201cLangevin flow\u201d. The oracle would return a list of pointers, \u201cgiven your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishop\u2019s PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of \u2026\u201d. Google is not such an oracle for my purpose. \n\nI\u2019m willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle. \nIs it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration? \n\nEDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend *specific* books or MOOC series that focus more on **intuition and breadth**. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation! \n\nEDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many people from different backgrounds to join the discussion. Looks like there are many who resonate with me! And thank you so much for all the great advice and recommendations. Please keep adding links, book titles, and your stories!

        "body":"I have seen so many posts on social media about how great pytorch is and, in one latest tweet, 'boomers' use tensorflow ... It doesn't make sense to me and I see it as being incredibly powerful and widely used in research and industry. Should I be jumping ship? What is the actual difference and why is one favoured over the other? I have only used tensorflow and although I have been using it for a number of years now, still am learning. Should I be switching? Learning both? I'm not sure this post will answer my question but I would like to hear your honest opinion why you use one over the other or when you choose to use one instead of the other.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for your responses. I honestly did not expect to get this much information and I will definitely be taking a harder look at Pytorch and maybe trying it in my next project. For those of you in industry, do you see tensorflow used more or Pytorch in a production type implementation? My work uses tensorflow and I have heard it is used more outside of academia - mixed maybe at this point?\n\nEDIT2: I read through all the comments and here are my summaries and useful information to anyone new seeing this post or having the same question: \n\nTL;DR: People were so frustrated with TF 1.x that they switched to PT and never came back.\n\n* Python is 30 years old FYI \n* Apparently JAX is actually where the cool kids are \u2026 this is feeling like highschool again, always the wrong crowd. \n* Could use pytorch to develop then convert with ONNX to tensorflow for deployment \n* When we say TF we should really say tf.keras. I would not wish TF 1.x on my worst enemy. \n* Can use PT in Colab. PT is also definitely popular on Kaggle\n* There seems to be some indie kid rage where big brother google is not loved so TF is not loved. \n* TF 2.x with tf.keras and PT seem to now do similar things. However see below for some details. Neither seems perfect but I am now definitely looking at PT. Just looking at the installation and docs is a winner. As a still TF advocate (for the time being) I encourage you to check out TF 2.x - a lot of comments are related to TF 1.x Sessions etc.\n\nReasons for: \n\n* PT can feel laborious. With tf.keras it seems to be simpler and quicker, however also then lack of control. \n* Seems to still win the production argument \n* TF is now TF.Keras. Eager execution etc. has made it more align with PT \n* TF now has numpy implementation right in there. As well as gradient tape in for loop fashion making it actually really easy to manipulate tensors.\n* PT requires a custom training loop from the get go. Maybe TF 2.x easier then for beginners now and can be faster to get a quick and dirty implementation \/ transfer learning. \n* PT requires to specify the hardware too (?) You need to tell it which gpu to use? This was not mentioned but that is one feeling I had. \n* Tf.keras maybe more involved in industry because of short implementation time \n* Monitoring systems? Not really mentioned but I don't know what is out there for PT. eg TF dashboard, projector\n* PT needs precise handling of input output layer sizes. You have to know math.\n* How is PT on edge devices - is there tfLite equivalent? PT Mobile it seems\n\nReason for Pytorch or against TF:\n\n* Pythonic\n* Actually opensource\n* Steep learning curve for TF 1.x. Many people seem to have switched and never looked back on TF 2.x. Makes sense since everything is the same for PT since beginning\n* Easier implementation (it just works is a common comment)\n* Backward compatibility and framework changes in TF. RIP your 1.x code. Although I have heard there is a tool to auto convert to TF 2.x - never tried it though. I'm sure it fails unless your code is perfect. Pytorch is stable through and through.\n* Installation. 3000 series GPUs. I already have experience with this. I hate having to install TF on any new system. Looks like PT is easier and more compatible.\n* Academia is on PT kick. New students learning it as the first. Industry doesn't seem to care much as long as it works and any software devs can use it.\n* TF has an issue of many features \/ frameworks trying to be forced together, creating incompatibility issues. Too many ways to do one thing, not all of which will actually do what you need down the road. \n* Easier documentation - potentially. \n* The separation between what is in tf and tf.keras\n* Possible deprecation for Jax, although with all the hype I honestly see Jax maybe just becoming TF 3.x\n* Debug your model by accessing intermediate representations (Is this what MLIR in TF is now?)\n* Slow TF start-up\n* PyTorch has added support for ROCm 4.0 which is still in beta. You can now use AMD GPUs! WOW - that would be great, although I like the nvidia monopoly for my stocks!\n* Although tf.keras is now simple and quick, it may be oversimplified. PT seems to be a nice middle for any experimentation. \n\nFunny \/ excellent comments: \n\n* \"I'd rather be punched in the face than having to use TensorFlow ever again.\" \n* \" PyTorch == old-style Lego kits where they gave pretty generic blocks that you could combine to create whatever you want. TensorFlow == new-style Lego kits with a bunch of custom curved smooth blocks, that you can combine to create the exact picture on the box; but is awkward to build anything else. \n* On the possibility of dropping TF for Jax. \"So true, Google loves killing things: hangouts, Google plus, my job application..\" \n* \"I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved. - Andrej Karpathy (2017)\" \n* \"I feel like there is 'I gave up on TF and never looked back feel here'\"\n* \"I hated the clusterfuck of intertwined APIs of TF2.\" \n* \"\u2026Pytorch had the advantage of being the second framework that could learn from the mistakes of Tensorflow - hence it's huge success.\" \n* \"Keras is the gateway drug of DL!\" \n* \"like anything Google related they seemed to put a lot of effort into making the docs extremely unreadable and incomplete\" \n* \"more practical imo, pytorch is - the yoda bot\" \n* \"Pytorch easy, tensorflow hard, me lazy, me dumb. Me like pytorch.\"",

Recently I needed a remote job so I applied to company X which claims they hire the top 3% (No one knows how they got this number).\n\nI applied two times, the first time passed the coding test and failed in the technical interview cause I wasn't able to solve 2 questions within 30min (solved the first one and the second almost got it before the time is up).\n\nSecond Trial: I acknowledged my weaknesses and grinded Leetcode for a while (since this is what only matters these days to get a job), and applied again, this time I moved to the Technical Interview phase directly, again chatted a bit (doesn't matter at all what you will say about our experience) and he gave me a dataset and asked to reach 96% accuracy within 30 min :D :D, I only allowed to navigate the docs but not StackOverflow or google search, I thought this should be about showing my abilities to understand the problem, the given data and process it as much as I can and get a good result fastly.\n\nso I did that iteratively and reached 90% ACC, some extra features had Nans, couldn't remember how to do it with Numby without searching (cause I already stacked multiple features together in an array), and the time is up, I told him what I would have done If I had more time.\n\nThe next day he sent me a rejection email, after asking for an explanation he told me \" **Successful candidates can do more progress within the time given, as have experience with pandas as they know (or they can easily find out) the pandas functions that allow them to do things quickly (for example, encoding categorical values, can be done in one line, and handling missing values can also be done in one line** \" (I did it as a separate process cause I'm used to having a separate processing function while deploying).\n\nWhy the fuck my experience is measured by how quickly I can remember and use Pandas functions without searching them? I mainly did NLP work for 3 years, I only used Pandas and Jupyter as a way of analyzing the data and navigating it before doing the actual work, why do I need to remember that? so not being able to one-line code (which is shitty BTW if you actually building a project you would get rid of pandas as much as you can) doesn't mean I'm good enough to be top 3% :D.\n\nI assume at this point top1% don't need to code right? they just mentally telepath with the tools and the job is done by itself.\n\nIf after all these years of working and building projects from scratch literally(doing all the SWE and ML jobs alone) doesn't matter cause I can't do one-line Jupyter pandas code, then I'm doomed.\n\nand Why the fuk everything is about speed these days?

At a high level, here are the main reasons why I find it hard to justify working 8+ hours a day on ML:\n\n1. **The world is burning** (Covid, climate change, social unrest), and I'm constantly wondering what the opportunity cost is for not doing something more immediately impactful and meaningful. I try to be more humble and accept that the world doesn't need me to \"save\" it. But it also feels wrong to just hunker down and tinker with hyperparameters all day.\n2. In the deep learning era, the day-to-day ML work feels like **shooting in the dark**. Honestly every time I try to do something principled and grounded in theory, reality slaps me in the face. It just doesn't work. What does work is anticlimactic: training bigger & longer, or arbitrarily tweaking BERT for whatever niche.\n3. **The field is so crowded**. The arxiv firehose is overwhelming and (forgive my cynicism) so full of noise. So much gets published everyday, yet so little. There's this crazy race to publish anything, regardless how meaningless that extra layer you added to BERT is. And while I really try to keep my integrity and not write a paper about how I swept the s\\*\\*\\* out of those hyperparameters and increased the average GLUE score by a whooping 0.2, realistically I still need to keep up with this crazy pace if I don't want to get fired.\n\nI feel trapped because I can't find pleasure neither in the process (which has become synonymous with throwing stuff at BERT and seeing what happens), nor the outcome (wasting huge amounts of compute power in a world that is burning, occasionally discovering mildly uninteresting things). At the end of the day, I'm depleted of energy and so can't rely on other areas of my life to fill in the void.\n\nEnlighten me! What's your secret? How do you keep going?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your thoughtful messages \/ advice and for sharing your experiences.

        "body":"I have been hearing some negativity about PhDs recently, much of it justified I am sure. However, as someone who has largely enjoyed their PhD in reinforcement learning, I thought I might explain some of the great things that can come from a PhD and give my advice on things to consider. My advice is not scientific and I am sure many others have written better advice you should also read\\*. \n\nThat being said, here is a list of things which can make doing a PhD really satisfying:\n\n1. A productive relationship with your advisor\/supervisor. If you are lucky, you will find a supervisor who is a world expert and who responds promptly to your questions, takes interest in your ideas and suggests helpful improvements.\n2. The opportunity to learn about interesting topics without expectation of concrete output.\n3. Day to day work which matches the skill set you want to develop\n4. The autonomy to build a project based on your own ideas\n5. The expertise of the lab and your ability to collaborate, receive feedback and socialise with them\n6. Getting a chance to intern with industry\n7. Publishing your work at top tier conferences and journals\n\nIf you can get all of these things out of your PhD it can be a really fun and worthwhile experience and, with a bit of luck, will set you up for great career opportunities afterwards. However, working things out before starting can be hard. So lets say you've narrowed it down to a few advisors, how do you evaluate points 1-7? Here are some tips:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Read carefully your potential advisor\u2019s best publications and recent impactful work. Check if they have successfully supervised students in the past. Get in contact with current or past students to hear how they work with their supervisor currently. If you can, do a rotation project as part of a PhD program or Masters degree.\n2. Find out if people in the lab have a lot of pressure to publish. If they do, it may make it difficult to learn about other areas. Is your lab\/University a hub for creative ideas from a variety of perspectives with opportunities to attend interesting lectures and interact with talented people?\n3. You will be an expert in the area(s) in which you do your PhD. Think about the skill set that would give you and your ability to sell that after the PhD. Equally, think about the process of acquiring those skills, and whether you would enjoy that process.\n4. Does your advisor already have a narrow project laid out for you or is it a broader picture (I would recommend the latter, although it does come with more risk). Does your advisor publish across a narrow range of topics or does he or she publish work in multiple related areas? Is that work high quality or low quality?\n5. Meet current lab members and try to get a sense of their interests, expertise and willingness to collaborate. If they have recent publications read them and ask them about it.\n6. An internship during your PhD is great both for learning and building a career. Machine learning is unusual in its ability to provide these opportunities so take them if you can!\n7. Do people in your lab regularly publish in top tier conferences and journals? Is their work widely cited, or more concretely, has it directly impacted research in the field?\n\nFinally, bear in mind that in reality it is very unlikely you have an opportunity which satisfies all these criteria, so be reasonable in your expectations, balance them against non-PhD opportunities and having evaluated all the evidence carefully, follow your gut. Good luck!\n\nOh, and one more thing:\n\nThe sunk cost fallacy is real. When thinking about your existing projects and future projects, don\u2019t be afraid to change tack if you worked hard on an idea and it just isn\u2019t panning out. Similarly, don\u2019t be afraid to change supervisor and or people you collaborate with if you honestly gave it your best shot and things are not working out. Be aware of when you are spinning your wheels and not making progress and do everything you can (within reason of course) to get out of it. If things get really bad, don\u2019t be afraid to drop out. A PhD should be about excitement and opportunity and not fear of failure. Save that for the rest of your life!\n\n\\*Sources of better advice include Richard Hamming and E.O Wilson\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IzPcu0-ETTU&ab\\_channel=TED](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IzPcu0-ETTU&ab_channel=TED)",

What did I miss? What did I get wrong?\n\nThe methods \u2013 roughly sorted from largest to smallest expected speed-up \u2013 are:\n\n1. Consider using a different learning rate schedule.\n2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader.\n3. Max out the batch size.\n4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).\n5. Consider using a different optimizer.\n6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking.\n7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs.\n8. Use gradient\/activation checkpointing.\n9. Use gradient accumulation.\n10. Use DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training.\n11. Set gradients to None rather than 0.\n12. Use .as\\_tensor rather than .tensor()\n13. Turn off debugging APIs if not needed.\n14. Use gradient clipping.\n15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm.\n16. Turn off gradient computation during validation.\n17. Use input and batch normalization.\n\n## 1. Consider using another learning rate schedule\n\nThe learning rate (schedule) you choose has a large impact on the speed of convergence as well as the generalization performance of your model.\n\nCyclical Learning Rates and the 1Cycle learning rate schedule are both methods introduced by Leslie N. Smith ([here](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1506.01186.pdf) and [here](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1708.07120)), and then popularised by fast.ai's Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger ([here](https:\/\/www.fast.ai\/2018\/07\/02\/adam-weight-decay\/) and [here](https:\/\/github.com\/sgugger\/Deep-Learning\/blob\/master\/Cyclical%20LR%20and%20momentums.ipynb)). Essentially, the 1Cycle learning rate schedule looks something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sc37u5knmxa61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7ce59b886e16df84201701e2266a3743d02796f0\n\nSylvain writes:\n\n>\\[1cycle consists of\\] \u00a0two steps of equal lengths, one going from a lower learning rate to a higher one than go back to the minimum. The maximum should be the value picked with the Learning Rate Finder, and the lower one can be ten times lower. Then, the length of this cycle should be slightly less than the total number of epochs, and, in the last part of training, we should allow the learning rate to decrease more than the minimum, by several orders of magnitude.\n\nIn the best case this schedule achieves a massive speed-up \u2013 what Smith calls *Superconvergence* \u2013 as compared to conventional learning rate schedules. Using the 1Cycle policy he needs \\~10x fewer training iterations of a ResNet-56 on ImageNet to match the performance of the original paper, for instance). The schedule seems to perform robustly well across common architectures and optimizers.\n\nPyTorch implements both of these methods `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR,` see [the documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/optim.html).\n\nOne drawback of these schedulers is that they introduce a number of additional hyperparameters. [This post](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/hyper-parameter-tuning-techniques-in-deep-learning-4dad592c63c8) and [this repo](https:\/\/github.com\/davidtvs\/pytorch-lr-finder), offer a nice overview and implementation of how good hyper-parameters can be found including the Learning Rate Finder mentioned above.\n\nWhy does this work? It doesn't seem entirely clear but one[ possible explanation](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1506.01186.pdf) might be that regularly increasing the learning rate helps to traverse [saddle points in the loss landscape ](https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/2015\/file\/430c3626b879b4005d41b8a46172e0c0-Paper.pdf)more quickly.\n\n## 2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader\n\nWhen using [torch.utils.data.DataLoader](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), set `num_workers > 0`, rather than the default value of 0, and `pin_memory=True`, rather than the default value of False. Details of this are [explained here](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html).\n\n[Szymon Micacz](https:\/\/nvlabs.github.io\/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial\/files\/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a 2x speed-up for a single training epoch by using four workers and pinned memory.\n\nA rule of thumb that [people are using ](https:\/\/discuss.pytorch.org\/t\/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader\/813\/5)to choose the number of workers is to set it to four times the number of available GPUs with both a larger and smaller number of workers leading to a slow down.\n\nNote that increasing num\\_workerswill increase your CPU memory consumption.\n\n## 3. Max out the batch size\n\nThis is a somewhat contentious point. Generally, however, it seems like using the largest batch size your GPU memory permits will accelerate your training (see [NVIDIA's Szymon Migacz](https:\/\/nvlabs.github.io\/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial\/files\/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf), for instance). Note that you will also have to adjust other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, if you modify the batch size. A rule of thumb here is to double the learning rate as you double the batch size.\n\n[OpenAI has a nice empirical paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1812.06162.pdf) on the number of convergence steps needed for different batch sizes. [Daniel Huynh](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/implementing-a-batch-size-finder-in-fastai-how-to-get-a-4x-speedup-with-better-generalization-813d686f6bdf) runs some experiments with different batch sizes (also using the 1Cycle policy discussed above) where he achieves a 4x speed-up by going from batch size 64 to 512.\n\n[One of the downsides](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1609.04836.pdf) of using large batch sizes, however, is that they might lead to solutions that generalize worse than those trained with smaller batches.\n\n## 4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)\n\nThe release of PyTorch 1.6 included a native implementation of Automatic Mixed Precision training to PyTorch. The main idea here is that certain operations can be run faster and without a loss of accuracy at semi-precision (FP16) rather than in the single-precision (FP32) used elsewhere. AMP, then, automatically decide which operation should be executed in which format. This allows both for faster training and a smaller memory footprint.\n\nIn the best case, the usage of AMP would look something like this:\n\n    import torch\n    # Creates once at the beginning of training\n    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()\n    \n    for data, label in data_iter:\n       optimizer.zero_grad()\n       # Casts operations to mixed precision\n       with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():\n          loss = model(data)\n    \n       # Scales the loss, and calls backward()\n       # to create scaled gradients\n       scaler.scale(loss).backward()\n    \n       # Unscales gradients and calls\n       # or skips optimizer.step()\n       scaler.step(optimizer)\n    \n       # Updates the scale for next iteration\n       scaler.update()\n\nBenchmarking a number of common language and vision models on NVIDIA V100 GPUs, [Huang and colleagues find](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/blog\/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision\/) that using AMP over regular FP32 training yields roughly 2x \u2013 but upto 5.5x \u2013 training speed-ups.\n\nCurrently, only CUDA ops can be autocast in this way. See the [documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/amp.html#op-eligibility) here for more details on this and other limitations.\n\nu\/SVPERBlA points out that you can squeeze out some additional performance (\\~ 20%) from AMP on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs if you convert your tensors to the [Channels Last memory format](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/intermediate\/memory_format_tutorial.html). Refer to [this section](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/deeplearning\/performance\/dl-performance-convolutional\/index.html#tensor-layout) in the NVIDIA docs for an explanation of the speedup and more about NCHW versus NHWC tensor formats.\n\n## 5. Consider using another optimizer\n\nAdamW is Adam with weight decay (rather than L2-regularization) which was popularized by fast.ai and is now available natively in PyTorch as `torch.optim.AdamW`. AdamW seems to consistently outperform Adam in terms of both the error achieved and the training time. See [this excellent blog](https:\/\/www.fast.ai\/2018\/07\/02\/adam-weight-decay\/) post on why using weight decay instead of L2-regularization makes a difference for Adam.\n\nBoth Adam and AdamW work well with the 1Cycle policy described above.\n\nThere are also a few not-yet-native optimizers that have received a lot of attention recently, most notably LARS ([pip installable implementation](https:\/\/github.com\/kakaobrain\/torchlars)) and [LAMB](https:\/\/github.com\/cybertronai\/pytorch-lamb).\n\nNVIDA's APEX implements fused versions of a number of common optimizers such as [Adam](https:\/\/nvidia.github.io\/apex\/optimizers.html). This implementation avoid a number of passes to and from GPU memory as compared to the PyTorch implementation of Adam, yielding speed-ups in the range of 5%.\n\n## 6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking\n\nIf your model architecture remains fixed and your input size stays constant, setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` might be beneficial ([docs](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/backends.html#torch-backends-cudnn)). This enables the cudNN autotuner which will benchmark a number of different ways of computing convolutions in cudNN and then use the fastest method from then on.\n\nFor a rough reference on the type of speed-up you can expect from this, [Szymon Migacz](https:\/\/nvlabs.github.io\/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial\/files\/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a speed-up of 70% on a forward pass for a convolution and a 27% speed-up for a forward + backward pass of the same convolution.\n\nOne caveat here is that this autotuning might become very slow if you max out the batch size as mentioned above.\n\n## 7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs\n\nBeware of frequently transferring tensors from a GPU to a CPU using `tensor.cpu()` and vice versa using `tensor.cuda()` as these are relatively expensive. The same applies for `.item()` and `.numpy()` \u2013 use `.detach()` instead.\n\nIf you are creating a new tensor, you can also directly assign it to your GPU using the keyword argument `device=torch.device('cuda:0')`.\n\nIf you do need to transfer data, using `.to(non_blocking=True)`, might be useful [as long as you don't have any synchronization points](https:\/\/discuss.pytorch.org\/t\/should-we-set-non-blocking-to-true\/38234\/4) after the transfer.\n\nIf you really have to, you might want to give Santosh Gupta's [SpeedTorch](https:\/\/github.com\/Santosh-Gupta\/SpeedTorch) a try, although it doesn't seem entirely clear when this actually does\/doesn't provide speed-ups.\n\n## 8. Use gradient\/activation checkpointing\n\nQuoting directly from the [documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/checkpoint.html):\n\n>Checkpointing works by trading compute for memory. Rather than storing all intermediate activations of the entire computation graph for computing backward, the checkpointed part does **not** save intermediate activations, and instead recomputes them in backward pass. It can be applied on any part of a model.  \n>  \n>Specifically, in the forward pass, function will run in [torch.no\\_grad()](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/generated\/torch.no_grad.html#torch.no_grad) manner, i.e., not storing the intermediate activations. Instead, the forward pass saves the inputs tuple and the functionparameter. In the backwards pass, the saved inputs and function is retrieved, and the forward pass is computed on function again, now tracking the intermediate activations, and then the gradients are calculated using these activation values.\n\nSo while this will might slightly increase your run time for a given batch size, you'll significantly reduce your memory footprint. This in turn will allow you to further increase the batch size you're using allowing for better GPU utilization.\n\nWhile checkpointing is implemented natively as `torch.utils.checkpoint`([docs](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/checkpoint.html)), it does seem to take some thought and effort to implement properly. Priya Goyal [has a good tutorial ](https:\/\/github.com\/prigoyal\/pytorch_memonger\/blob\/master\/tutorial\/Checkpointing_for_PyTorch_models.ipynb)demonstrating some of the key aspects of checkpointing.\n\n## 9. Use gradient accumulation\n\nAnother approach to increasing the batch size is to accumulate gradients across multiple `.backward()` passes before calling optimizer.step().\n\nFollowing [a post](https:\/\/medium.com\/huggingface\/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) by Hugging Face's Thomas Wolf, gradient accumulation can be implemented as follows:\n\n    model.zero_grad()                                   # Reset gradients tensors\n    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(training_set):\n        predictions = model(inputs)                     # Forward pass\n        loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)       # Compute loss function\n        loss = loss \/ accumulation_steps                # Normalize our loss (if averaged)\n        loss.backward()                                 # Backward pass\n        if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:             # Wait for several backward steps\n            optimizer.step()                            # Now we can do an optimizer step\n            model.zero_grad()                           # Reset gradients tensors\n            if (i+1) % evaluation_steps == 0:           # Evaluate the model when we...\n                evaluate_model()                        # ...have no gradients accumulate\n\nThis method was developed mainly to circumvent GPU memory limitations and I'm not entirely clear on the trade-off between having additional `.backward()` loops. [This discussion](https:\/\/forums.fast.ai\/t\/accumulating-gradients\/33219\/28) on the fastai forum seems to suggest that it can in fact accelerate training, so it's probably worth a try.\n\n## 10. Use Distributed Data Parallel for multi-GPU training\n\nMethods to accelerate distributed training probably warrant their own post but one simple one is to use `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` rather than `torch.nn.DataParallel`. By doing so, each GPU will be driven by a dedicated CPU core avoiding the GIL issues of DataParallel.\n\nIn general, I can strongly recommend reading the [documentation on distributed training.](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/beginner\/dist_overview.html)\n\n## 11. Set gradients to None rather than 0\n\nUse `.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` rather than `.zero_grad()`.\n\nDoing so will let the memory allocator handle the gradients rather than actively setting them to 0. This will lead to yield a *modest* speed-up as they say in the [documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/optim.html), so don't expect any miracles.\n\nWatch out, doing this is not side-effect free! Check the docs for the details on this.\n\n## 12. Use .as_tensor() rather than .tensor()\n\n`torch.tensor()` always copies data. If you have a numpy array that you want to convert, use `torch.as_tensor()` or `torch.from_numpy()` to avoid copying the data.\n\n## 13. Turn on debugging tools only when actually needed\n\nPyTorch offers a number of useful debugging tools like the [autograd.profiler](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/autograd.html#profiler), [autograd.grad\\_check](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/autograd.html#numerical-gradient-checking), and [autograd.anomaly\\_detection](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/autograd.html#anomaly-detection). Make sure to use them to better understand when needed but to also turn them off when you don't need them as they will slow down your training.\n\n## 14. Use gradient clipping\n\nOriginally used to avoid exploding gradients in RNNs, there is both some [empirical evidence as well as some theoretical support](https:\/\/openreview.net\/forum?id=BJgnXpVYwS) that clipping gradients (roughly speaking: `gradient = min(gradient, threshold)`) accelerates convergence.\n\nHugging Face's [Transformer implementation](https:\/\/github.com\/huggingface\/transformers\/blob\/7729ef738161a0a182b172fcb7c351f6d2b9c50d\/examples\/run_squad.py#L156) is a really clean example of how to use gradient clipping as well as some of the other methods such as AMP mentioned in this post.\n\nIn PyTorch this can be done using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`([documentation](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/generated\/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)).\n\nIt's not entirely clear to me which models benefit how much from gradient clipping but it seems to be robustly useful for RNNs, Transformer-based and ResNets architectures and a range of different optimizers.\n\n## 15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm\n\nThis is a very simple one: turn off the bias of layers before BatchNormalization layers. For a 2-D convolutional layer, this can be done by setting the bias keyword to False: `torch.nn.Conv2d(..., bias=False, ...)`. \u00a0(Here's a r[eminder why this makes sense](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/46256747\/can-not-use-both-bias-and-batch-normalization-in-convolution-layers).)\n\nYou will save some parameters, I would however expect the speed-up of this to be relatively small as compared to some of the other methods mentioned here.\n\n## 16. Turn off gradient computation during validation\n\nThis one is straightforward: set `torch.no_grad()` during validation.\n\n## 17. Use input and batch normalization\n\nYou're probably already doing this but you might want to double-check:\n\n* Are you [normalizing](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/torchvision\/transforms.html) your input?\n* Are you using [batch-normalization](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/generated\/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html)?\n\nAnd [here's](https:\/\/stats.stackexchange.com\/questions\/437840\/in-machine-learning-how-does-normalization-help-in-convergence-of-gradient-desc) a reminder of why you probably should.\n\n### Bonus tip from the comments: Use JIT to fuse point-wise operations.\n\nIf you have adjacent point-wise operations you can use [PyTorch JIT](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/jit.html#creating-torchscript-code) to combine them into one FusionGroup which can then be launched on a single kernel rather than multiple kernels as would have been done per default. You'll also save some memory reads and writes.\n\n[Szymon Migacz shows](https:\/\/nvlabs.github.io\/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial\/files\/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) how you can use the `@torch.jit.script` decorator to fuse the operations in a GELU, for instance:\n\n    @torch.jit.script\n    def fused_gelu(x):\n        return x * 0.5 * (1.0 + torch.erf(x \/ 1.41421))\n\nIn this case, fusing the operations leads to a 5x speed-up for the execution of `fused_gelu`  \nas compared to the unfused version.\n\nSee also [this post](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/blog\/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript\/) for an example of how Torchscript can be used to accelerate an RNN.\n\nHat tip to u\/Patient_Atmosphere45 for the suggestion.\b\n\n## Sources and additional resources\n\nMany of the tips listed above come from Szymon Migacz' [talk](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9mS1fIYj1So) and post in the [PyTorch docs](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/recipes\/recipes\/tuning_guide.html).\n\nPyTorch Lightning's William Falcon has [two](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/9-tips-for-training-lightning-fast-neural-networks-in-pytorch-8e63a502f565) [interesting](https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/7-tips-for-squeezing-maximum-performance-from-pytorch-ca4a40951259) posts with tips to speed-up training. [PyTorch Lightning](https:\/\/github.com\/PyTorchLightning\/pytorch-lightning) does already take care of some of the points above per-default.\n\nThomas Wolf at Hugging Face has a [number](https:\/\/medium.com\/@Thomwolf) of interesting articles on accelerating deep learning \u2013 with a particular focus on language models.\n\nThe same goes for [Sylvain Gugger](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/category\/basics.html) and [Jeremy Howard](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LqGTFqPEXWs): they have many interesting posts in particular on [learning](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/the-1cycle-policy.html) [rates](https:\/\/sgugger.github.io\/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html) and [AdamW](https:\/\/www.fast.ai\/2018\/07\/02\/adam-weight-decay\/).\n\n*Thanks to Ben Hahn, Kevin Klein and Robin Vaaler for their feedback on a draft of this post!*\n\n**I've also put all of the above into this** [**blog post**](https:\/\/efficientdl.com\/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide\/)**.**",

The  network architecture is different than mine and the performance  evaluation is different, but the main selling point of my article, the  usage of these shape priors has already been published. I am a bit  devastated at this point because this would have been my first 1st  author paper and I really put a lot of effort and thought into this,  only to discover that my idea has already been discovered before.  Obviously I need to do a much more thorough literature review next time  so that this doesn't happen again, but besides that, I don't know what  else I could do to mitigate the damage that has been done to my  motivation.

Of the 15,000 images, I found (and corrected) issues with 4,986 (33%) of them.\n\n**Commentary:**  \nThis is really scary. I discovered this because we're working on converting and re-hosting popular datasets in many popular formats for easy use across models... I first noticed that there were a bunch of completely unlabeled images.\n\nUpon digging in, I was appalled to find that fully 1\/3 of the images contained errors or omissions! Some are small (eg a part of a car on the edge of the frame or a ways in the distance not being labeled) but some are egregious (like the woman in the crosswalk with a baby stroller).\n\nI think this really calls out the importance of rigorously inspecting any data you plan to use with your models. Garbage in, garbage out... and self-driving cars should be treated seriously.\n\nI went ahead and corrected by hand the missing bounding boxes and fixed a bunch of other errors like phantom annotations and duplicated boxes. There are still quite a few duplicate boxes (especially around traffic lights) that would have been tedious to fix manually, but if there's enough demand I'll go back and clean those as well.\n\n**Corrected Dataset:** [https:\/\/public.roboflow.ai\/object-detection\/self-driving-car](https:\/\/public.roboflow.ai\/object-detection\/self-driving-car)",

        "body":"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways & tricks I got from it.  I\u2019m going to leave out the basic things because there\u2019s enough posts about them, i\u2019m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.\n\nI\u2019ve also put the insights into a [deck](https:\/\/saveall.ai\/shared\/deck\/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4&reddit_posts) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app like anki or** [**save all**](https:\/\/saveall.ai\/landing\/reddit_posts) **for the things you learn** otherwise you\u2019ll just forget so much of what is important. Here\u2019s the takeaways:\n\n# Neural Network Training Fundamentals\n\n* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**\n   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset\n   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc\u2026\n* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data\n* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models\n   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn\u2019t then you have a bug!\n   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!\n* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first\n* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**\n   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN\n   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range\n\n# Transfer Learning\n\n* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task\n   * e.g. see [huggingface](http:\/\/huggingface.co\/) for help with this in NLP\n* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model\n   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one\n   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)\n\n# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting\n\n* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods\n* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:\n   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images\n   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https:\/\/github.com\/QData\/TextAttack) for this)\n* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints\n* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction\n\n# Other Tricks to Improve Performance\n\n* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input\n* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**\n* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate\n* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!\n* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit\n* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https:\/\/github.com\/PyTorchLightning\/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set\n* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range\n   * I.e. make the network output:  min\\_value + sigmoid(output) \\* (max\\_value - min\\_value)\n* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance\n* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)\n* **Don\u2019t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem\n* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)\n* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful\n* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know if you found this helpful and if there are any other training tricks you use that we should also know about?",

I assumed this meant it was a false positive, but decided to dig into why that might be. I sent Microsoft the files saying they were a false positive, and they responded saying that the files were indeed malicious. The IP addresses for the malicious files point to hosts that have been compromised numerous times in the past according to a quick search.\n\nI believe there are two versions of gray-bat.gif, with one containing the malware and the other is completely clean. Somewhere along the line, a check is performed to determine what file to give the user requesting it and that's why some people end up with a file that doesn't contain malware. I don't know exactly what it checks for, but using wget seems to reliably get the malicious file.\n\nWhen looking at this URL:\n\n> http:\/\/www. learnanimals . com\/gray-bat\/gray-bat.gif\n\nI find that it has a redirect to this page:\n\n> http:\/\/www. learnanimals . com\/cgi-sys\/suspendedpage.cgi \n\nThis suspendedpage.cgi page has HTML code that contains a redirect to a URL that I suspect contains the malicious file:\n\nhttps:\/\/pastebin.com\/HXPxcgTV\n\nIt may be related to this: https:\/\/blog.malwarebytes.com\/threat-analysis\/2015\/02\/deceiving-cpanel-account-suspended-page-serves-exploits\/\n\nThe URL that's redirected to appears to be associated with malware distribution.

I could be completely wrong about this, so keep that in mind. I also don't know if this possible malware is a threat to anyone downloading the ImageNet dataset or who the intended targets are. I also haven't checked every ImageNet image, as I've only been using a few synsets.\n\nEdit:\n\nGoogle Drive is now suddenly reporting the files as infected with a virus, but most AV tools are still not detecting anything. I also uploaded the files to VirusTotal here: https:\/\/www.virustotal.com\/gui\/file\/bf1c1063f889d834a826d8e7c79134c2a674705f2504ce4af6018d4b0d47f980\/detection",

This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more detail.",

Do we expect people to have to remember all the maths of the machine learning?\n\nNo ways, i dont remember 99% of what i studied in college. But thats not the point. When applying these algorithms, one must know the underlying principles of it, and not just which python library they need to import.\n\n2. Do I mean people should not work on Deep Learning or not make a hype of it, as its not the best thing?\n\nNot at all, Deep Learning is the frontier of Machine Learning and its the mind blowing potential of deep learning which brought most of us into the domain.\nAll i meant was, in this rush to apply deep learning to everything, we must not lose sight of simpler models, which most companies across the world still use and would continue to use due to there interpretability.\n\n3. What do I mean by Democratization of ML.\n\nML is a revolutionary knowledge, we can all agree on that, and therefore it is essential that such knowledge be made available to all the people, so they can learn about its potential and benifit from the changes it brings to there lives, rather then being intimidated by it.

        "body":"I come from a traditional engineering field, and here is my observation about ML publication practice lately:\n\nI have noticed that there are groups of researchers working on the intersection of \"old\" fields such as optimization, control, signal processing and the like, who will all of a sudden publish a massive amount of paper that purports to solve a certain problem. The problem itself is usually recent and sometimes involves some deep neural network.\n\nHowever, upon close examination, the only novelty is the problem (usually proposed by other unaffiliated groups) but not the method proposed by the researchers that purports to solve it.\n\nI was puzzled by why a very large amount of seemingly weak papers, literally rehashing (occasionally, well-known) techniques from the 1980s or even 60s are getting accepted, and I noticed the following recipe:\n\n1. **Only ML conferences.** These groups of researchers will only ever publish in machine learning conferences (and not to optimization and control conferences\/journals, where the heart of their work might actually lie). For example, on a paper about adversarial machine learning, the entire paper was actually about solving an optimization problem, but the optimization routine is basically a slight variation of other well studied methods. ***Update***: I also noticed that if a paper does not go through NeurIPS or ICLR, they will be directly sent to AAAI and some other smaller name conferences, where they will be accepted. So nothing goes to waste in this field.\n2. **Peers don't know what's going on.** Through openreview, I found that the reviewers (not just the researchers) are uninformed about their particular area, and only seem to comment on the correctness of the paper, but not the novelty. In fact, I doubt the reviewers themselves know about the novelty of the method. ***Update***: by novelty I meant how novel it is with respect to the state-of-the-art of a certain technique, especially when it intersects with operations research, optimization, control, signal processing. The state-of-the-art *could be* far ahead than what mainstream ML folks know about.\n3. **Poor citation practices.** Usually the researchers will only cite themselves or other \"machine learning people\" (whatever this means) from the last couple of years. Occasionally, there will be 1 citation from hundreds of years ago attributed to Cauchy, Newton, Fourier, Cournot, Turing, Von Neumann and the like, and then a hundred year jump to 2018 or 2019. I see, \"This problem was studied by *some big name* in 1930 and *Random Guy XYZ* in 2018\" a lot.\n4. **Wall of math.** Frequently, there will be a massive wall of math, proving some esoteric condition on the eigenvalue, gradient, Jacobian, and other curious things about their problem (under other esoteric assumptions). There will be several theorems, none of which are applicable because the moment they run their highly non-convex deep learning application, all conditions are violated. Hence the only thing obtained from these intricate theorems + math wall are some faint intuition (which are violated immediately). And then nothing is said. \n\n***Update***: If I could add one more, it would be that certain techniques, after being proposed, and after the authors claim that it beats a lot of benchmarks, will be seemingly be abandoned and never used again. ML researchers seem to like to jump around topics a lot, so that might be a factor. But usually in other fields, once a technique is proposed, it is refined by the same group of researchers over many years, sometimes over the course of a researcher's career.\n\nIn some ways, this makes certain area of ML sort of an echo chamber, where researchers are pushing through a large amount of known results rehashed and somewhat disguised by the novelty of their problem and these papers are all getting accepted because no one can detect the lack of novelty (or when they do detect, it is only 1 guy out of 3 reviewers). I just feel like ML conferences are sort of being treated as some sort of automatic paper acceptance cash cow.\n\nJust my two cents coming from outside of ML. My observation does not apply to all fields of ML.",

These functions only provide the illusion of security. For example, it's simple to capture the screen of your smartphone using another camera, and thus cirumventing the screenshot-proofing and self-destruction of the private images. However, we found that the .comdom app only *increases* the illusion of security.\n\nIn a matter of days, we (IDLab-MEDIA from Ghent University) were able to automatically remove these visible watermarks from images. We watermarked thousands of random pictures in the same way that the .comdom app does, and provided those to a simple convolutional neural network with these images.

CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players. \u00a0 Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games. \u00a0 Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:\n\n* **NLP x RL\/Planning:**\u00a0CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL\/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine.\u00a0\n* **Controlling dialogue via plans:**\u00a0In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO\u2019s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.\n* **Selecting plans:**\u00a0CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength\/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends\/receives a message.\n* **Filtering messages:**\u00a0We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state\/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO\u2019s messages.\u00a0\n* **Human-like play:**\u00a0Over the course of 72 hours of play \u2013 which involved sending 5,277 messages \u2013 CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.\n\nYou can check out some of our materials and open-sourced artifacts here:\u00a0\n\n* [Research paper](https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.ade9097)\n* [Project overview](https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/research\/cicero\/)\n* [Diplomacy gameplay page](https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/research\/cicero\/diplomacy\/)\n* [Github repo](https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/diplomacy_cicero)\n* [Our latest blog post](https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/blog\/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people\/)\n\nJoining us today for the AMA are:\n\n* Andrew Goff (AG), 3x Diplomacy World Champion\n* Alexander Miller (AM), Research Engineering Manager\n* Noam Brown (NB), Research Scientist [(u\/NoamBrown)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/NoamBrown\/)\n* Mike Lewis (ML), Research Scientist [(u\/mikelewis0)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/mikelewis0\/)\n* David Wu (DW), Research Engineer [(u\/icosaplex)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/icosaplex\/)\n* Emily Dinan (ED), Research Engineer\n* Anton Bakhtin (AB), Research Engineer\n* Adam Lerer (AL), Research Engineer\n* Jonathan Gray (JG), Research Engineer\n* Colin Flaherty (CF), Research Engineer [(u\/c-flaherty)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/c-flaherty)\n\nWe\u2019ll be here on December 8, 2022 @ 10:00AM PT - 11:00AM PT.",

        "body":"**TL;DR:** GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we're at a point where other research directions matter more\n\nI also posted it on my [blog here](https:\/\/www.singlelunch.com\/2020\/12\/28\/why-im-lukewarm-on-graph-neural-networks\/), has footnotes, a nicer layout with inlined images, etc.\n\n-----------\n\nI'm only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.\n\nIt might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. [There][1] were at least [four][2] [review][3] [papers][4] just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we're also focusing on some incorrect places.\n\nBut first, let's take a step back and go over the basics.\n\n# Models are about compression\n\nWe say graphs are a \"non-euclidean\" data type, but that's not really true. A regular graph is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the [adjacency matrix][5], like [this](https:\/\/www.singlelunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif).\n\nIt's weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it \"non-euclidean\".\n\nThis is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, *where the non-zero numbers are* matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.\n\n**If you had the full matrix, life would be easy**\n\nIf we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn't a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.\n\nFirst, network node embeddings aren't a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it's already a vector of numbers.\n\nSecond, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we're attaching to nodes.\n\n**NLP is also just fancy matrix compression**\n\nLet's take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be [thought of in terms of graphs][6] as we'll see, so it's not a big digression.\n\nFirst, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like [Word2Vec][7] and [GloVe][8] are [just matrix factorization][9].\n\nThe GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old [bag of words][10] matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) [co-occurence][11] graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.\n\nGlove then does matrix factorization on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent.\n\nYou can read more on this in my [post on embeddings][12] and the one (with code) on [word embeddings][13].\n\n**Even language models are also just matrix compression**\n\nLanguage models are all the rage. They dominate most of the [state of the art][14] in NLP.\n\nLet's take BERT as our main example. BERT predicts a word given the context of the [rest of the sentence](https:\/\/www.singlelunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/bert.png).\n\nThis grows the matrix we're factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence's context, like [this](https:\/\/www.singlelunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png)\n\nWe're growing the \"ideal matrix\" we're factoring combinatorially. As noted by [Hanh & Futrell][15]:\n\n> [...] human language\u2014and language modelling\u2014has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the [Kolmogorov Complexity][16] sense. It's also possible that huge language models just [memorize a lot of it][17] rather than compress the information, for what it's worth.\n\n### Can we upsample any graph like language models do?\n\nWe're already doing it.\n\nLet's call a **first-order** embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph's adjacency matrix or [Laplacian matrix][18]. If you embed a graph using [Laplacian Eigenmaps][19] or by taking the [principal components][20] of the Laplacian, that's first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is [ProNE][21], which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.\n\nA **higher-order** method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. [GraRep][22], shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix.\n\nHigher order method are the \"upsampling\" we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.\n\n# Where are the performance gain?\n\nMost GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.\n\nAs noted in the [OpenGraphsBenchmark][4] (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can't seriously differentiate between methods.\n\nRecent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.\n\n**Performance matters by task**\n\nOne fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you're doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there [isn't much gained][23] from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings (This makes sense, because the full context of the sentence is captured in the sentence co-occurence matrix that is generating the Word2Vec embeddings).\n\nSimilarly, [I find][24] that for many graphs **simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods**. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases.\n\nRecommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my [GGVec with order=1][25].\n\nHigher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks. I'm not the only one to find this. In the BioNEV paper, they find: \"A large GraRep order value for link prediction tasks (e.g. 3, 4);a small value for node classification tasks (e.g.1, 2)\" (p.9).\n\nInterestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to [real world graphs][26].\n\nFor visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated\/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by [Owen Cornec][27] created by first embedding the graph to 32-300 dimensions using a node embedding algorithm, then mapping this to 2d or 3d with the excellent UMAP algorithm, like [this](https:\/\/www.singlelunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png)\n\nLastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there's an instance of it in the OGB paper).\n\nThe problem here is that **we don't know when any method is better than another** and **we definitely don't know the reason**.\n\nThere's definitely a reason different graph types respond better\/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.\n\nA big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because...\n\n# Academic incentives work against progress\n\nHere's the cynic's view of how machine learning papers are made:\n\n1.  Take an existing algorithm\n2.  Add some new layer\/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters\n3.  Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped\n4.  Absolutely don't gridsearch stuff you're comparing against in your results section\n5.  Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github (Or no code at all!) and bask in the citations\n\nI'm [not][28] the [only one][29] with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it's gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.\n\n### Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec\n\nA side project of mine is a [node embedding library][25] and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don't use Node2Vec.\n\n[Node2Vec][30] with `p=1; q=1` is the [Deepwalk][31] algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.\n\nThe Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.\n\nThis is not academic fraud -- the hyperparameters [do help a tiny bit][32] if you gridsearch really hard. But it's the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn't deserve 7500 citations.\n\n# Progress is all about practical issues\n\nWe've known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with [AlexNet][33] in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was **practical**.\n\nSimilarly, we've known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.\n\nBut word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware.\n\nIt's hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You're disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google's original search algorithm [initially ran on commodity hardware][34].\n\n**Efficiency is paramount to progress**\n\nThe reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in [efficiency][35] as well as much better libraries and hardware support.\n\n**Academic code is terrible**\n\nAny amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on `p` and `q` is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself (on number of walks, length of walks, or word2vec hyperparameters). The problem is that people don't gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.\n\nI wrote the [Nodevectors library][36] to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took **32 hours** to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It's no wonder people don't gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.\n\nTo give an example, in the original paper of [GraphSAGE][37] they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5, which is horrid if you've ever hyperparameter tuned a deepwalk algorithm. From their paper:\n\n> We did observe DeepWalk\u2019s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for >1000\u00d7 longer than the other approaches (in terms of wall clock time for prediction on the test set) I don't even think the GraphSAGE authors had bad intent -- deepwalk implementations are simply so awful that they're turned away from using it properly. It's like trying to do deep learning with 2002 deep learning libraries and hardware.\n\n# Your architectures don't really matter\n\nOne of the more important papers this year was [OpenAI's \"Scaling laws\"][38] paper, where the raw number of parameters in your model is the most predictive feature of overall performance. This was noted even in the original BERT paper and drives 2020's increase in absolutely massive language models.\n\nThis is really just [Sutton' Bitter Lesson][39] in action:\n\n> General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin\n\nTransformers might be [replacing convolution][40], too. As [Yannic Kilcher said][41], transformers are ruining everything. [They work on graphs][6], in fact it's one of the [recent approaches][42], and seems to be one of the more succesful [when benchmarked][1]\n\nResearchers seem to be putting so much effort into architecture, but it doesn't matter much in the end because you can approximate anything by stacking more layers.\n\nEfficiency wins are great -- but neural net architectures are just one way to achieve that, and by tremendously over-researching this area we're leaving a lot of huge gains elsewhere on the table.\n\n# Current Graph Data Structure Implementations suck\n\nNetworkX is a bad library. I mean, it's good if you're working on tiny graphs for babies, but for anything serious it chokes and forces you to rewrite everything in... what library, really?\n\nAt this point most people working on large graphs end up hand-rolling some data structure. This is tough because your computer's memory is a 1-dimensional array of 1's and 0's and a graph has no obvious 1-d mapping.\n\nThis is even harder when we take updating the graph (adding\/removing some nodes\/edges) into account. Here's a few options:\n\n### Disconnected networks of pointers\n\nNetworkX is the best example. Here, every node is an object with a list of pointers to other nodes (the node's edges).\n\nThis layout is like a linked list. Linked lists are the [root of all performance evil][43].\n\nLinked lists go completely against how modern computers are designed. Fetching things from memory is slow, and operating on memory is fast (by two orders of magnitude). Whenever you do anything in this layout, you make a roundtrip to RAM. It's slow by design, you can write this in Ruby or C or assembly and it'll be slow regardless, because memory fetches are slow in hardware.\n\nThe main advantage of this layout is that adding a new node is O(1). So if you're maintaining a massive graph where adding and removing nodes happens as often as reading from the graph, it makes sense.\n\nAnother advantage of this layout is that it \"scales\". Because everything is decoupled from each other you can put this data structure on a cluster. However, you're really creating a complex solution for a problem you created for yourself.\n\n### Sparse Adjacency Matrix\n\nThis layout great for read-only graphs. I use it as the backend in my [nodevectors][25] library, and many other library writers use the [Scipy CSR Matrix][44], you can see graph algorithms implemented on it [here][45].\n\nThe most popular layout for this use is the [CSR Format][46] where you have 3 arrays holding the graph. One for edge destinations, one for edge weights and an \"index pointer\" which says which edges come from which node.\n\nBecause the CSR layout is simply 3 arrays, it scales on a single computer: a CSR matrix can be laid out on a disk instead of in-memory. You simply [memory map][47] the 3 arrays and use them on-disk from there.\n\nWith modern NVMe drives random seeks aren't slow anymore, much faster than distributed network calls like you do when scaling the linked list-based graph. I haven't seen anyone actually implement this yet, but it's in the roadmap for my implementation at least.\n\nThe problem with this representation is that adding a node or edge means rebuilding the whole data structure.\n\n### Edgelist representations\n\nThis representation is three arrays: one for the edge sources, one for the edge destinations, and one for edge weights. [DGL][48] uses this representation internally.\n\nThis is a simple and compact layout which can be good for analysis.\n\nThe problem compared to CSR Graphs is some seek operations are slower. Say you want all the edges for node #4243. You can't jump there without maintaining an index pointer array.\n\nSo either you maintain sorted order and binary search your way there (O(log2n)) or unsorted order and linear search (O(n)).\n\nThis data structure can also work on memory mapped disk array, and node append is fast on unsorted versions (it's slow in the sorted version).\n\n# Global methods are a dead end\n\nMethods that work on the **entire graph at once** can't leverage computation, because they run out of RAM at a certain scale.\n\nSo any method that want a chance of being the new standard need to be able to update piecemeal on parts of the graph.\n\n**Sampling-based methods**\n\nSampling Efficiency will matter more in the future\n\n*   **Edgewise local methods**. The only algorithms I know of that do this are GloVe and GGVec, which they pass through an edge list and update embedding weights on each step. \n\nThe problem with this approach is that it's hard to use them for higher-order methods. The advantage is that they easily scale even on one computer. Also, incrementally adding a new node is as simple as taking the existing embeddings, adding a new one, and doing another epoch over the data\n\n*   **Random Walk sampling**. This is used by deepwalk and its descendants, usually for node embeddings rather than GNN methods. This can be computationally expensive and make it hard to add new nodes.\n\nBut this does scale, for instance [Instagram][49] use it to feed their recommendation system models\n\n*   **Neighbourhood sampling**. This is currently the most common one in GNNs, and can be low or higher order depending on the neighborhood size. It also scales well, though implementing efficiently can be challenging.\n\nIt's currently used by [Pinterest][50]'s recommendation algorithms.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHere are a few interesting questions:\n\n*   What is the relation between graph types and methods?\n*   Consolidated benchmarking like OGB\n*   We're throwing random models at random benchmarks without understanding why or when they do better\n*   More fundamental research. Heree's one I'm curious about: can other representation types like [Poincarre Embeddings][51] effectively encode directed relationships?\n\nOn the other hand, we should **stop focusing on** adding spicy new layers to test on the same tiny datasets.

The deposition also names Prince Andrew of Britain and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, among others.\n\nThe accusation against Minsky was made by Virginia Giuffre, who was deposed in May 2016 as part of a broader defamation suit between her and an Epstein associate named Ghislaine Maxwell. In the deposition, Giuffre says she was directed to have sex with Minsky when he visited Epstein\u2019s compound in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nAs part of the defamation suit, Maxwell\u2019s counsel denied the allegations, calling them \u201csalacious and improper.\u201d Representatives for Giuffre and Maxwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA separate witness lent credence to Giuffre\u2019s account, testifying that she and Minsky had taken a private plane from Teterboro to Santa Fe and Palm Beach in March 2001. Epstein, Maxwell, chef Adam Perry Lang, and shipping heir Henry Jarecki were also passengers on the flight, according to the deposition. At the time of the flight, Giuffre was 17; Minsky was 73.\n\nGot a tip for us? Use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity.

He also developed the first head-mounted display, a precursor to modern VR and augmented reality systems.\n\nMinsky was one of a number of prominent scientists with ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who often called himself a \u201cscience philanthropist\u201d and donated to research projects and academic institutions. Many of those scientists were affiliated with Harvard, including physicist Lawrence Krauss, geneticist George Church, and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker. Minsky\u2019s affiliation with Epstein went particularly deep, including organizing a two-day symposium on artificial intelligence at Epstein\u2019s private island in 2002, as reported by Slate. In 2012, the Jeffrey Epstein Foundation issued a press release touting another conference organized by Minsky on the island in December 2011.\n\nThat private island is alleged to have been the site of an immense sex trafficking ring. But Epstein associates have argued that those crimes were not apparent to Epstein\u2019s social relations, despite the presence of young women at many of his gatherings.\n\n\u201cThese people were seen not only by me,\u201d Alan Dershowitz argued in a 2015 deposition. \u201cThey were seen by Larry Summers, they were seen by \\[George\\] Church, they were seen by Marvin Minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people,\u201d Dershowitz continued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/8\/9\/20798900\/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/8\/9\/20798900\/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed)",

        "body":"Behind paywall:\n\nWith new machine-learning models coming online daily, the company created a new system to track their impact and maximize user engagement. The process is still the same today. Teams train up a new machine-learning model on FBLearner, whether to change the ranking order of posts or to better catch content that violates Facebook\u2019s community standards (its rules on what is and isn\u2019t allowed on the platform). Then they test the new model on a small subset of Facebook\u2019s users to measure how it changes engagement metrics, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares, says Krishna Gade, who served as the engineering manager for news feed from 2016 to 2018.\n\nIf a model reduces engagement too much, it\u2019s discarded. Otherwise, it\u2019s deployed and continually monitored. On Twitter, Gade explained that his engineers would get notifications every few days when metrics such as likes or comments were down. Then they\u2019d decipher what had caused the problem and whether any models needed retraining.\n\nBut this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff. Sometimes this inflames existing political tensions. The most devastating example to date is the case of Myanmar, where viral fake news and hate speech about the Rohingya Muslim minority escalated the country\u2019s religious conflict into a full-blown genocide. Facebook admitted in 2018, after years of downplaying its role, that it had not done enough \u201cto help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence.\u201d\n\nWhile Facebook may have been oblivious to these consequences in the beginning, it was studying them by 2016. In an internal presentation from that year, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, a company researcher, Monica Lee, found that Facebook was not only hosting a large number of extremist groups but also promoting them to its users: \u201c64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools,\u201d the presentation said, predominantly thanks to the models behind the \u201cGroups You Should Join\u201d and \u201cDiscover\u201d features.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2021\/03\/11\/1020600\/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation\/",

I'm really scared about forgetting what he sounds like and my intention is to produce a large number of recordings of his voice.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew of anything out there that use machine learning to capture his voice and generate new recordings. It would be great if it was something I could use in a text-to-speech engine. Not only could I have something to remember him by and share with my future children, but he could potentially use in a speech synthesizer so he can still speak in his own voice.\n\nI have come across one or two companies that claim to do it for the purpose of tweaking interviews, but on contacting them I haven't had much success.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.

These algorithms are trained to maximize profit by influencing people's attention, information streams and priority queues. I think its truly a shame that working for Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter etc is seen as \"the holy grail\" as an ML engineer\/ researcher.  The best paid (and therefore probably some of the most skilled) people in our field are working on th\u00e1t. Not medicine, not science.. no, they work on recommender algorithms that act as catalysts for the worst in humanity, in turn for more ad revenue. A glaring (but fixed) example is a 13 year old girl watching diet videos will get anorexia videos recommended on YouTube, not because it's good for her, but because it maximizes the time she spends on YouTube to generate more ad revenue. And it works. Because it worked for thousands of other 13 year olds watching diet videos. \n\n My apologies for a bit of a rant but I'm genuinely curious how other ML developers think about this. This is one of the biggest (or probably even THE biggest) impact that machine learning has on the world right now, yet I barely hear about it on this sub (I hope I'm wrong on this). \n\nDo you think people that developed these algorithms bear some responsibility? Do you think they knew the impact of their algorithms? And finally, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like no one is discussing this here. Why is that?",

Optionally, if this is your first time using Google Colab, view this [Colab introduction](https:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/notebooks\/intro.ipynb) and\/or this [Colab FAQ](https:\/\/research.google.com\/colaboratory\/faq.html).\n2. Click [this link](https:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/drive\/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing).\n3. Sign into your Google account if you're not already signed in. Click the \"S\" button in the upper right to do this. Note: Being signed into a Google account has privacy ramifications, such as your Google search history being recorded in your Google account.\n4. In the Table of Contents, click \"Parameters\".\n5. Find the line that reads \"tx = clip.tokenize('''a cityscape in the style of Van Gogh''')\" and change the text inside of the single quote marks to your desired text; example: \"tx = clip.tokenize('''a photo of New York City''')\". The developer recommends that you keep the three single quote marks on both ends of your desired text so that mult-line text can be used  An alternative is to remove two of the single quotes on each end of your desired text; example: \"tx = clip.tokenize('a photo of New York City')\".\n6. In the Table of Contents, click \"Restart the kernel...\".\n7. Position the pointer over the first cell in the notebook, which starts with text \"import subprocess\". Click the play button (the triangle) to run the cell. Wait until the cell completes execution.\n8. Click menu item \"Runtime->Restart and run all\".\n9. In the Table of Contents, click \"Diagnostics\". The output appears near the end of the Train cell that immediately precedes the Diagnostics cell, so scroll up a bit. Every few minutes (or perhaps 10 minutes if Google assigned you relatively slow hardware for this session), a new image will appear in the Train cell that is a refinement of the previous image. This process can go on for as long as you want until Google ends your Google Colab session, which is a total of [up to 12 hours](https:\/\/research.google.com\/colaboratory\/faq.html) for the free version of Google Colab.\n\n**Steps to follow if you want to start a different run using the same Google Colab session:**\n\n1. Click menu item \"Runtime->Interrupt execution\".\n2. Save any images that you want to keep by right-clicking on them and using the appropriate context menu command.\n3. Optionally, change the desired text. Different runs using the same desired text almost always results in different outputs.\n4. Click menu item \"Runtime->Restart and run all\".\n\n**Steps to follow when you're done with your Google Colab session**:\n\n1. Click menu item \"Runtime->Manage sessions\". Click \"Terminate\" to end the session.\n2. Optionally, log out of your Google account due to the privacy ramifications of being logged into a Google account.\n\nThe first output image in the Train cell (using the notebook's default of seeing every 100th image generated) usually is a very poor match to the desired text, but the second output image often is a decent match to the desired text. To change the default of seeing every 100th image generated, change the number 100 in line \"if itt % 100 == 0:\" in the Train cell to the desired number. **For free-tier Google Colab users, I recommend changing 100 to a small integer such as 5.**\n\nTips for the text descriptions that you supply:\n\n1. In Section 3.1.4 of OpenAI's [CLIP paper](https:\/\/cdn.openai.com\/papers\/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) (pdf), the authors recommend using a text description of the form \"A photo of a {label}.\" or \"A photo of a {label}, a type of {type}.\" for images that are photographs.\n2. A Reddit user gives [these tips](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MediaSynthesis\/comments\/l2hmqn\/this_aint_it_chief\/gk8g8e9\/).\n3. The Big Sleep should generate [these 1,000 types of things](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MediaSynthesis\/comments\/l7hbix\/tip_for_users_of_the_big_sleep_it_should_on\/) better on average than other types of things.\n\n[Here](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/news\/big-sleep-ai-image-generator\/) is an article containing a high-level description of how The Big Sleep works. The Big Sleep uses a modified version of [BigGAN](https:\/\/aiweirdness.com\/post\/182322518157\/welcome-to-latent-space) as its image generator component. The Big Sleep uses the ViT-B\/32 [CLIP](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/clip\/) model to rate how well a given image matches your desired text. The best CLIP model according to the CLIP paper authors is the (as of this writing) unreleased ViT-L\/14-336px model; see Table 10 on page 40 of the [CLIP paper (pdf)](https:\/\/cdn.openai.com\/papers\/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf) for a comparison.\n\nThere are [many other sites\/programs\/projects](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/ldc6oc\/p_list_of_sitesprogramsprojects_that_use_openais\/) that use CLIP to steer image\/video creation to match a text description.\n\nSome relevant subreddits:\n\n1. [r\/bigsleep](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bigsleep\/) (subreddit for images\/videos generated from text-to-image machine learning algorithms).\n2. [r\/deepdream](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/deepdream\/) (subreddit for images\/videos generated from machine learning algorithms).\n3.

        "body":"Hey there,\n\nLet's get straight to the point : yesterday, NVIDIA released an open source[ pytorch implementation of flownet2](https:\/\/github.com\/NVIDIA\/flownet2-pytorch), which released a CUDA version of the correlation layer introduced by the paper [FlowNet](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1504.06852). It turns out out that this code is protected by NVIDIA copyright while it heavily reuse parts of a code I wrote myslef 6 months ago : [FlowNet Pytorch](https:\/\/github.com\/ClementPinard\/FlowNetPytorch)\n\nMy goal is not to rant or to fulfil my self esteem, but to figure what to do in the most pragmatic manner in order to take the best of both worlds and make the best implementation possible.\n\nThat's not the most important part, but as a proof, here are some comparisons you can make :\n\n[mine](https:\/\/github.com\/ClementPinard\/FlowNetPytorch\/blob\/607f99f46be3eccbd9b07c73848a68bc12156392\/multiscaleloss.py#L8) - [theirs](https:\/\/github.com\/NVIDIA\/flownet2-pytorch\/blob\/master\/losses.py#L46)\n\n[mine](https:\/\/github.com\/ClementPinard\/FlowNetPytorch\/blob\/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912\/models\/FlowNetS.py#L32) - [theirs](https:\/\/github.com\/NVIDIA\/flownet2-pytorch\/blob\/master\/networks\/FlowNetS.py#L11)\n\n[mine](https:\/\/github.com\/ClementPinard\/FlowNetPytorch\/blob\/5381bd5c699b850785ab5dec6fda523b9126c912\/models\/FlowNetS.py#L9) - [theirs](https:\/\/github.com\/NVIDIA\/flownet2-pytorch\/blob\/master\/networks\/submodules.py#L7)\n\nNow as a disclaimer, I am very honoured they decided to use my code, and it is very obvious that my code is not rocket science and the main contribution of this project is not these little snippets but rather the custom layers and the pretrained weights for pytorch.\n\nHowever, the fact that the README is not giving any credit for what I did feels a little uncool, especially with a [License file](https:\/\/github.com\/NVIDIA\/flownet2-pytorch\/blob\/master\/LICENSE) saying that all copyright goes to NVIDIA.\n\nMy other concern is that the parts of the code that got copied were actually not very well written, and the implementation in my own repo is to my mind much better now (for example [`MulstiScaleLoss`](https:\/\/github.com\/NVIDIA\/flownet2-pytorch\/blob\/master\/losses.py#L46) module is a nightmare to read and to use while pytorch gives tools for making it [much more readable](https:\/\/github.com\/ClementPinard\/FlowNetPytorch\/blob\/master\/multiscaleloss.py#L15)). I could make several Pull Requests but it's not garanteed to be merged rapidly and I'd prefer to contact the author first to get things straight and make them know that all I want is the best flownet2 implementation, and as this project is already gaining a lot of stars, it would be pointless to do my own fork ^with ^blackjack ^and ^hookers\n\nMy huge mistake was maybe to not have put a License in my code in the first place, but apparently, [a default one still holds](https:\/\/help.github.com\/articles\/licensing-a-repository\/#choosing-the-right-license).\n\nSo what would be the best to do to get to work constructively with the project authors to improve their implementation and maybe also get a little credit for the code on which they built this project ? (also, is my claim reasonable ?)\n\nThanks in advance for your help !\n\nEDIT thanks for your comments, I'll contact the main committor of the repo and hopefully everything will be alright! I am glad to see that it was indeed a reasonable claim\n\nEDIT2 matter is solved for me, I got in touch with them quickly, thanks everyone for your help !",

GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code, and suggests individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI. The GitHub Copilot technical preview is available as a Visual Studio Code extension.\n\n> **How good is GitHub Copilot?**\n> We recently benchmarked against a set of Python functions that have good test coverage in open source repos. We blanked out the function bodies and asked GitHub Copilot to fill them in. The model got this right 43% of the time on the first try, and 57% of the time when allowed 10 attempts. And it\u2019s getting smarter all the time.\n\nThe service is based on OpenAI's Codex model, which has not been released yet but [Greg Brockman (OpenAI CTO) tweeted that it will be made available through their API later this summer](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gdb\/status\/1409890354132750336?s=20)",

        "body":"Understanding searches better than ever before\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the 15 years working on Google Search, it\u2019s that people\u2019s curiosity is endless. We see billions of searches every day, and 15 percent of those queries are ones we haven\u2019t seen before--so we\u2019ve built ways to return results for queries we can\u2019t anticipate.\n\nWhen people like you or I come to Search, we aren\u2019t always quite sure about the best way to formulate a query. We might not know the right words to use, or how to spell something, because often times, we come to Search looking to learn--we don\u2019t necessarily have the knowledge to begin with.\u00a0\n\nAt its core, Search is about understanding language. It\u2019s our job to figure out what you\u2019re searching for and surface helpful information from the web, no matter how you spell or combine the words in your query. While we\u2019ve continued to improve our language understanding capabilities over the years, we sometimes still don\u2019t quite get it right, particularly with complex or conversational queries. In fact, that\u2019s one of the reasons why people often use \u201ckeyword-ese,\u201d typing strings of words that they think we\u2019ll understand, but aren\u2019t actually how they\u2019d naturally ask a question.\u00a0\n\nWith the latest advancements from our research team in the science of language understanding--made possible by machine learning--we\u2019re making a significant improvement to how we understand queries, representing the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search.\u00a0\n\n**Applying BERT models to Search**  \nLast year, we [introduced and open-sourced](https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2018\/11\/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or as we call it--[BERT](https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2018\/11\/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html), for short. This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system.\u00a0\n\nThis breakthrough was the result of Google research on [transformers](https:\/\/ai.googleblog.com\/2017\/08\/transformer-novel-neural-network.html): models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it\u2014particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just advancements in software that can make this possible: we needed new hardware too. Some of the models we can build with BERT are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we\u2019re using the latest [Cloud TPUs ](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/ai-machine-learning\/cloud-tpu-pods-break-ai-training-records)to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly.\u00a0\n\n**Cracking your queries**  \nSo that\u2019s a lot of technical details, but what does it all mean for you? Well, by applying BERT models to both ranking and featured snippets in Search, we\u2019re able to do a much better job\u00a0 helping you find useful information. In fact, when it comes to ranking results, BERT will help Search better understand one in 10 searches in the U.S. in English, and we\u2019ll bring this to more languages and locales over time.\n\nParticularly for longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cto\u201d matter a lot to the meaning, Search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query. You can search in a way that feels natural for you.\n\nTo launch these improvements, we did a lot of [testing](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search\/howsearchworks\/mission\/users\/) to ensure that the changes actually are more helpful. Here are some of the examples that showed up our evaluation process that demonstrate BERT\u2019s ability to understand the intent behind your search.  \n\n\nHere\u2019s a search for \u201c2019 brazil traveler to usa need a visa.\u201d The word \u201cto\u201d and its relationship to the other words in the query are particularly important to understanding the meaning. It\u2019s about a Brazilian traveling to the U.S., and not the other way around. Previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the importance of this connection, and we returned results about U.S. citizens traveling to Brazil. With BERT, Search is able to grasp this nuance and know that the very common word \u201cto\u201d actually matters a lot here, and we can provide a much more relevant result for this query.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another query: \u201cdo estheticians stand a lot at work.\u201d Previously, our systems were taking an approach of matching keywords, matching the term \u201cstand-alone\u201d in the result with the word \u201cstand\u201d in the query. But that isn\u2019t the right use of the word \u201cstand\u201d in context. Our BERT models, on the other hand, understand that \u201cstand\u201d is related to the concept of the physical demands of a job, and displays a more useful response.\n\nHere are some other examples where BERT has helped us grasp the subtle nuances of language that computers don\u2019t quite understand the way humans do.\n\n**Improving Search in more languages**  \nWe\u2019re also applying BERT to make Search better for people across the world. A powerful characteristic of these systems is that they can take learnings from one language and apply them to others. So we can take models that learn from improvements in English (a language where the vast majority of web content exists) and apply them to other languages. This helps us better return relevant results in the many languages that Search is offered in.\n\nFor featured snippets, we\u2019re using a BERT model to improve featured snippets in the two dozen countries where this feature is available, and seeing significant improvements in languages like Korean, Hindi and Portuguese.\n\n**Search is not a solved problem**  \nNo matter what you\u2019re looking for, or what language you speak, we hope you\u2019re able to let go of some of your keyword-ese and search in a way that feels natural for you. But you\u2019ll still stump Google from time to time. Even with BERT, we don\u2019t always get it right. If you search for \u201cwhat state is south of Nebraska,\u201d BERT\u2019s best guess is a community called \u201cSouth Nebraska.\u201d (If you've got a feeling it's not in Kansas, you're right.)\n\nLanguage understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and it keeps us motivated to continue to improve Search. We\u2019re always getting better and working to find the meaning in-- and most helpful information for-- every query you send our way.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/search-language-understanding-bert\/)",

        "body":"he did not call it GAN, he called it curiosity, it's actually famous work, many citations in all the papers on intrinsic motivation and exploration, although I bet many GAN people don't know this yet\n\nI learned about it through his [inaugural tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SchmidhuberAI) on their [miraculous year](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html). I knew LSTM, but I did not know that he and Sepp Hochreiter did all those other things 30 years ago. \n\nThe blog sums it up in section 5 Artificial Curiosity Through Adversarial Generative Neural Networks (1990)\n\n> The first NN is called the controller C. C (probabilistically) generates outputs that may influence an environment. The second NN is called the world model M. It predicts the environmental reactions to C's outputs. Using gradient descent, M minimises its error, thus becoming a better predictor. But in a zero sum game, C tries to find outputs that maximise the error of M. M's loss is the gain of C.  \n\n> That is, C is motivated to invent novel outputs or experiments that yield data that M still finds surprising, until the data becomes familiar and eventually boring. Compare more recent summaries and extensions of this principle, e.g., [AC09]. \n\n> GANs are an application of Adversarial Curiosity [AC90] where the environment simply returns whether C's current output is in a given set [AC19].\n\nSo I read those referenced papers. [AC19](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1906.04493) is kinda modern guide to the old report [AC90](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf) where the adversarial part first appeared in section: Implementing Dynamic Curiosity and Boredom, and the generative part in section: Explicit Random Actions versus Imported Randomness, which is like GANs versus conditional GANs. [AC09](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/multipleways2009.pdf) is a survey from 2009 and sums it up: maximise reward for prediction error.\n\nI know that Ian Goodfellow says he is the inventor of GANs, but he must have been a little boy when Jurgen did this in 1990. Also funny that Yann LeCun described GANs as \"the coolest idea in machine learning in the last twenty years\" although Jurgen had it thirty years ago  \n\nNo, it is NOT the same as predictability minimisation, that's yet another adversarial game he invented, in 1991, section 7 of his [explosive blog post which contains additional jaw-droppers](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html)",

I am expecting that I'll be rejected from the remaining programs soon. I didn't even get an interview chance, I was just rejected without speaking to anyone.\n\nI'll start with my profile (which I am willing to verify on a zoom call if any mod requests it). I grew up in a poor city in a third world country, to a very poor family. I managed to work hard during high school, ranking 3rd in my country in national exams, and got accepted on a full ride scholarship to a Hong Kong university. I have a GPA of 3.9+. I have a first author NeurIPS paper that was completed without any faculty advisors (Me and another undergraduate wrote the paper independently and it got accepted). I also have a paper in an A\\* information theory conference where we settled an open problem that has been open for 8 years. I have two submissions in TCS and IEEE Transactions on information theory (both A\\* journals), and one has already received a minor revision (on its way to be accepted). During my undergrad, my mother got breast cancer, and I had to work two part time jobs just to help with paying for the medical bills, while keeping up with my studies and my research. I remember I slept an average of 5 hours per day in the months of treatment. I have seen two of my LORs, both professors mentioned that I am the best undergraduate who has worked with them in their lifetime as Professors.\n\nI feel tired, mentally exhausted, and crushed. I've worked so hard over the last 8 years, just to have all my dreams destroyed. It doesn't help when everyone around me keeps saying I am \"a shoo-in for Stanford\". I just feel like I've been fighting an uphill fight all my life with no guidance, constantly having to work harder just to prove myself, and in the end, it still didn't work. I just don't understand what these top programs are looking for. I heard some programs like UWashington even interviewed the top 20% of applicants, which means I'm not even close.\n\n<\/rant>\n\nEdit: [This](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/lpt9xb\/d_re_yet_another_rant_on_phd_applications\/)  \n",

However, you have None included in the inputs in the first positional arg, so it's not triggering functional api construction.\n\n>That causes the layer to get 'inlined' in the outer functional model rather than correctly included. You should be able to work around this by changing the layer api so Nones should not get passed in.\n\n>We have a major cleanup\/refactoring of the Functional API mostly done that make the functional api triggering much clearer (if any symbolic values appear in the inputs) & sort out a number of other issues w\/ it. But, that will only land in 2.4. It's not immediately obvious if we can squeeze a fix into tf 2.3 as the RC is already out.\n\nIf you look at the notebooks, the inputs to some of the lines look like this:\n\n`    P_outputs = P_trans11((inputHiddenVals, None, None, None))[0]`\n\nIt looks like the issue is that the  are extra `None`s are causing disappearing variables issue, and a workaround could be just to have \n\n`    P_outputs = P_trans11(inputHiddenVals)[0]`\n\n\n\n\n----\n\ntl'dr: For anyone who has used the functional api with custom layers, it might be worth running\n\n\n    for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):\n        print(model.trainable_variables[i].name)\n    \n\nso see if all your weights are there. \n\n----\n\nUsing custom layers with the functional API results in missing weights in the `trainable_variables`. Those weights are not in the `non_trainable_variables` either. \n\nBut if those weights aren't in `trainable_variables`they are essential frozen, since it is only those weights that receive gradient updates, as seen in the Keras model training code below:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/tensorflow\/blob\/1fb8f4988d69237879aac4d9e3f268f837dc0221\/tensorflow\/python\/keras\/engine\/training.py#L2729\n\n\n      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_variables)\n    \n      # Whether to aggregate gradients outside of optimizer.

For an in-depth look, the colab gist below creates all the custom layers from scratch\n\nhttps:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/gist\/Santosh-Gupta\/aa34086a72956600910976e4f7ebe323\/model_weight_debug_scratch_public_inference_var.ipynb\n\n\nAs you can see in the notebooks, a workaround is to create models using keras subclassing instead; model subclassing results in all the weights appearing in `trainable_variables`. To be absolutely sure that the functional API and subclasses models are exactly the same, I ran inference on them using the same input at the bottom of each notebook; the outputs for the models were exactly the same. But training using the functional API model would treat many of the weights as frozen (and there's no way to make them unfrozen since those weights aren't registered in the `non_trainable_variables` either). \n\nI've been looking at this for about a month, as far as I can tell, I don't think there was anything unique about the transformer layer I created; it may be the case that Any Keras model using custom sublayers and the functional API is prone to this. \n\nI put up a Github issue 24 days ago, but I can't tell if this is something being worked on. \n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/tensorflow\/issues\/40638\n\nIf anyone else has been using the Keras functional API with custom layer, would love to hear if you're also getting the same issue when you check the trainable variables.",

For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06\/1k tokens to $0.02\/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.\n\nA much better model and a 1\/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.\n\nI have no idea how OpenAI can make money on this.

        "body":"Hi everyone,\n\nI'm of those (rare??) persons who does ML for a living but has no interest in doing it. I've built models using classical and deep learning approaches for 7-8 years, and a lot of them had decent impacts in the companies I've worked with. I'm good at what I do and I'm compensated well for it. However, nothing in the field of ML\/DL excites me anymore.\n\nI find it more enjoyable to solve problems in my math textbooks . In fact, I want a career in which I can do some form of mathematics but I don't want to do machine learning for the rest of my life. Before I shifted to ML for the money, I worked a lot on satellite systems engineering. I also took a lot of physics and EE courses during my masters degree (optics, quantum mechanics and solid state devices).\n\nI was thinking of a career in quantum information but I don't have a PhD yet. Also, my computer science skills aren't strong enough to switch to cryptography. Any thoughts \/ ideas on how to get out of machine learning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: 2nd March, 2022 \\[1\\]- Thanks a lot everyone for your answers\/comments. I'm overwhelmed and humbled by your responses. I'll reply to each one of you during this week or the next, whenever I find some time. I'm caught up in something personal.\n\n\\[2\\] I came across this course recently - [http:\/\/groups.csail.mit.edu\/gdpgroup\/6838\\_spring\\_2021.html](http:\/\/groups.csail.mit.edu\/gdpgroup\/6838_spring_2021.html). This one looks super exciting. Here's a course on discrete differential geometry that I found online -  [https:\/\/www.cs.cmu.edu\/\\~kmcrane\/Projects\/DDG\/](https:\/\/www.cs.cmu.edu\/~kmcrane\/Projects\/DDG\/). I'd love to explore differential geometry applied to ML problems (or vice versa).\n\n\\[3\\]  I would prefer to work on ML in fields like applied physics or genetics rather than banking, social media analytics or consumer electronics.\n\n\\[4\\] (This is a short rant)-  I'm sick of technical papers that have titles like \"X is all you need\" or \"Your classifier is secretly an energy based model and you should treat it like one\". I have nothing against anyone here and I'm absolutely certain that the authors are 100000x more knowledgable than I am but I'm very uncomfortable with such pompous paper titles. Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't seen catchy titles in physics or mathematics. This is one (trivial) reason why I don't want to pursue a PhD in ML. I hate the grandeur and style!!\n\n\\[5\\] Rant 2- Taking any online course from any platform does NOT make you a data scientist or an ML researcher. I hate the fact that not many of them are not willing to put in the time\/effort to learn the fundamental math behind ML algorithms. When I ask someone in an interview to explain what PCA is, they stop with the answer that PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. No word about eigenvalues\/eigenvectors or covariance matrix. :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body":"# The project\n\nI've been working on a new gym environment for quite a while, and I think it's finally at a point where I can share it. SoulsGym is an OpenAI gym extension for Dark Souls III. It allows you to train reinforcement learning agents on the bosses in the game. The Souls games are widely known in the video game community for being notoriously hard.\n\n.. Ah, and this is my first post on r\/MachineLearning, so please be gentle ;)\n\n# What is included?\n\n**SoulsGym**\n\nThere are really two parts to this project. The first one is [SoulsGym](https:\/\/github.com\/amacati\/SoulsGym), an OpenAI gym extension. It is compatible with the newest API changes after gym has transitioned to the Farama foundation. SoulsGym is essentially a game hacking layer that turns Dark Souls III into a gym environment that can be controlled with Python. However, you still need to own the game on Steam and run it before starting the gym. A detailed description on how to set everything up can be found in the package [documentation](https:\/\/soulsgym.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/?badge=latest).\n\n**Warning: If you want to try this gym, be sure that you have read the documentation and understood everything. If not handled properly, you can get banned from multiplayer.**\n\nBelow, you can find a video of an agent training in the game. The game runs on 3x speed to accelerate training. You can also watch the video on [YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7R5Ef69sFPE).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RL agent learning to defeat the first boss in Dark Souls III.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/134r0xf\/video\/o6ctdppeo8xa1\/player)\n\nAt this point, only the first boss in Dark Souls III is implemented as an environment. Nevertheless, SoulsGym can easily be extended to include other bosses in the game. Due to their similarity, it shouldn't be too hard to even extend the package to Elden Ring as well. If there is any interest in this in the ML\/DS community, I'd be happy to give the other ones a shot ;)\n\n**SoulsAI**\n\nThe second part is [SoulsAI](https:\/\/github.com\/amacati\/SoulsAI), a distributed deep reinforcement learning framework that I wrote to train on multiple clients simultaneously. You should be able to use it for other gym environments as well, but it was primarily designed for my rather special use case. SoulsAI enables live-monitoring of the current training setup via a webserver, is resilient to client disconnects and crashes, and contains all my training scripts. While this sounds a bit hacky, it's actually quite readable. You can find a complete documentation that goes into how everything works [here](https:\/\/soulsai.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/).\n\nBeing fault tolerant is necessary since the simulator at the heart of SoulsGym is a game that does not expose any APIs and has to be hacked instead. Crashes and other instabilities are rare, but can happen when training over several days. At this moment, SoulsAI implements ApeX style DQN and PPO, but since PPO is synchronous, it is less robust to client crashes etc. Both implementations use Redis as communication backend to send training samples from worker clients to a centralized training server, and to broadcast model updates from the server to all clients. For DQN, SoulsAI is completely asynchronous, so that clients never have to stop playing in order to perform updates or send samples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Live monitoring of an ongoing training process in SoulsAI.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9m060w00r8xa1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7d1a31032f902c24bf12d6cdebcf7ed91b904ed9)\n\nNote: I have not implemented more advanced training algorithms such as Rainbow etc., so it's very likely that one can achieve faster convergence with better performance. Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning is extremely challenging since training runs can easily take days across multiple machines.\n\n# Does this actually work?\n\nYes, it does! It took me some time, but I was able to train an agent with Duelling Double Deep Q-Learning that has a win rate of about 45% within a few days of training. In this video you can see the trained agent playing against Iudex Gundry. You can also watch the video on [YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=86NivRglr3Y).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RL bot vs Dark Souls III boss.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/134r0xf\/video\/rkor3hroj8xa1\/player)\n\nI'm also working on a visualisation that shows the agent's policy networks reacting to the current game input. You can see a preview without the game simultaneously running here. Credit for the idea of visualisation goes to [Marijn van Vliet](https:\/\/github.com\/wmvanvliet\/scns).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Duelling Double Q-Learning networks reacting to changes in the game observations.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/134r0xf\/video\/b0a4jzczv8xa1\/player)\n\nIf you really want to dive deep into the hyperparameters that I used or load the trained policies on your machine, you can find the final checkpoints [here](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1cAK1TbY4e4HE4cxyAFEHRpj6MOgp5Zxe?usp=sharing). The hyperparameters are contained in the *config.json* file.\n\n# ... But why?\n\nBecause it is a ton of fun! Training to defeat a boss in a computer game does not advance the state of the art in RL, sure. So why do it? Well, because we can! And because maybe it excites others about ML\/RL\/DL.\n\n**Disclaimer: Online multiplayer**\n\nThis project is in no way oriented towards creating multiplayer bots. It would take you ages of development and training time to learn a multiplayer AI starting from my package, so just don't even try. I also do not take any precautions against cheat detections, so if you use this package while being online, you'd probably be banned within a few hours.\n\n# Final comments\n\nAs you might guess, this project went through many iterations and it took a lot of effort to get it \"right\". I'm kind of proud to have achieved it in the end, and am happy to explain more about how things work if anyone is interested. There is a lot that I haven't covered in this post (it's really just the surface), but you can find more in the docs I linked or by writing me a pm. Also, I really have no idea how many people in ML are also active in the gaming community, but if you are a Souls fan and you want to contribute by adding other Souls games or bosses, feel free to reach out to me.\n\nEdit: Clarified some paragraphs, added note for online multiplayer.\n\nEdit2: Added hyperparameters and network weights.",

        "body":"Hi all,\n\nRecently I gave an invited talk at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory (my MA\/PhD alma mater) on **Theoretical Foundations of Graph Neural Networks**. The recording is now live (+ slides in the description!): [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc)\n\nHere I have made efforts to derive GNNs from first principles, motivate their use across the sciences, and explain how they emerged, in parallel, along several research lines. This represents a 'convergence' of the \\~4 years I've spent studying GNNs: I taught them in many ways over the years, and I feel like I have finally found, imho, the most 'natural' way to introduce them.\n\n*(For the amazing insights in this direction, I need to give a shout-out to my ongoing collaborators: Joan Bruna, Michael Bronstein and Taco Cohen!)*\n\nThe live Zoom session attracted \\~500 people, and I received many emails afterwards in support of the talk -- hence I believe it could be both of use to beginners in the area, and offer a new perspective to seasoned GNN practitioners. \n\nPlease let me know if you found it useful, and of **any** and all feedback! :)",

Then I used the BERT model as a filter (kind of like a GAN but without the feedback between generator and discriminator).  I also aded a BERT model to try to predict which comment would get the most upvotes.\n\nSeveral people replied to the output replies as if it was a real person so I think it probably passes a light Turing sniff test (maybe they were bots too, who knows?).  Hopefully nobody gets too mad that I tested the model in the wild. I ran it sparingly and made sure it wasn't saying anything inflammatory.\n\nI wrote up a [results overview](https:\/\/www.bonkerfield.org\/2020\/02\/combining-gpt-2-and-bert\/) and a [tutorial post](https:\/\/www.bonkerfield.org\/2020\/02\/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert\/) to explain how it works.

Even after a common publication [VAN3], the first author of reference [VAN2] published papers (e.g., [VAN4]) that cited only his own 1994 paper but not Sepp's original work.)\n\nSo Bengio republished at least 3 important ideas from Schmidhuber's lab without giving credit: meta-learning, vanishing gradients, GANs.

We empirically verified this on Transformers up to width 4096.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rwdsb6snlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0faac2112c556879992bda093f22eb0cb91dc356\n\nUsing this insight, we can just tune a tiny version of GPT-3 on a single GPU --- if the hyperparameters we get on the small model is near optimal, then they should also be near optimal on the large model! We call this way of tuning \\*\u00b5Transfer\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mi7ibyyolkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24bfbb234658d25d534cab1a2f2219f45b2e63a3\n\nWe \u00b5Transferred hyperparameters from a small 40 million parameter version of GPT-3 \u2014 small enough to fit on a single GPU \u2014 to the 6.7 billion version. With some asterisks, we get a performance comparable to the original GPT-3 model with twice the parameter count!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rrq2yfwplkm81.png?width=3232&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=519cf2adcbec60a611917d6126964b22f1fb1c2b\n\nThe total tuning cost is only 7% of the whole pretrain compute cost! Since the direct tuning of the small model costs roughly the same even as the large model increases in size, tuning the 175B GPT-3 this way would probably cost at most 0.3% of the total pretrain compute.\n\nYou: \"wait can I shrink the model only in width?\"\n\nBad news: there's not much theoretical guarantee for non-width stuff\n\ngood news: we empirically tested transfer across depth, batch size, sequence length, & timestep work within reasonable ranges on preLN transformers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x7fo95yqlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a967beb7b6b2777c07216642bf9a7eb91faa3898\n\nWe applied this to tune BERT-base and BERT-large simultaneously by shrinking them to the same small model in both width and depth, where we did the direct tuning. We got a really nice improvement over the already well-tuned megatron BERT baseline, especially for BERT-large!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/db5eausrlkm81.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c01676ad433167898c49f62f6c7a8862f3e1f4c4\n\nIn general, it seems that the larger a model is, the less well tuned it is --- which totally makes sense --- and thus the more to gain from \u00b5Transfer. We didn't have compute to retrain the GPT-3 175B model, but I'll leave your mouth watering with that thought.\n\nOK, so what actually is \u00b5P and how do you implement it?\n\nIt's encapsulated by the following table for how to scale your initialization and learning rate with fan-in or fan-out. The purple text is \u00b5P and the gray text in parenthesis is pytorch default, for reference, and the black text is shared by both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4475drzvlkm81.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c1de7bf7c52dff80973eaf61dcd5d8fa487f46d7\n\nBut just like you don't typically want to implement autograd by hand even though autograd is just chain rule, we recommend using our package [https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/mup](https:\/\/t.co\/5S0YAg026Z) to implement \u00b5P in your models.\n\nThe really curious ones of you: \"OK what is the theoretical motivation behind all this?\"\n\nUnfortunately, this is already getting long, so feel free to check out the [reddit thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/k8h01q\/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not\/) on [our previous theoretical paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2011.14522), and people let me know if this is something you want to hear for another time!\n\nBut I have to say that this is a rare occasion in deep learning where very serious mathematics has concretely delivered a result previously unthinkable, and I'm elated with how things turned out! In contrast to [this reddit thread a few days ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/t8fn7m\/d_are_we_at_the_end_of_an_era_where_ml_could_be\/), I think there are plenty of room for new, fundamental mathematics to change the direction of deep learning and artificial intelligence in general --- why chase the coattail of empirical research trying to \"explain\" them all when you can lead the field with deep theoretical insights?\n\nLet me know what you guys think in the comments, or feel free to email me (gregyang at microsoft dot com)!",

        "body":"Hi there. Earlier this month I had [a discussion](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hearthstone\/comments\/3zdibn\/intelligent_agents_for_hearthstone\/cylnbf2) over on \/r\/hearthstone with \/u\/yetipirate about Computer Go. Then the news hit this week of the first Go AI to beat a human professional.\n\nWe had some more discussion then, and I made a synopsis of [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NHRHUHW6HQE), where the US Go Association has Myungwan Kim, 9-Dan Pro, analyse the games between the AlphaGo AI and human professional Fan Hui, 2-Dan Pro. (FTR: Professional go ranks start at 1-Dan and go up to 9-Dan, but rather than the absolute top 9-Dan is more like the beginning of grandmastery. The best players in the world are like 9-Dan+++++. Lee Sedol, which AlphaGo will challenge next this March, is at this latter level.)\n\n\/u\/yetipirate suggested this synopsis might interest some people here as well, since it digests the salient points of a two hour video with lots of Go jargon into a more manageable post. So hence I'm posting it here, I hope you all enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions about Go, but I'm not that strong myself so ymmv. Anyway without further ado:\n\n**In General:**\n\nThe match has been big news in East-Asia as well. The thing which most shocked all the professionals was that AlphaGo played so much like a human player. Their first impressions were that it's as if this was a human playing, not a computer.\n\nSince how a human plays is, obviously, pretty well known, they decided that they'll focus commentary mostly on those cases where AlphaGo doesn't play like a human.\n\nThe first thing that Myungwan Kim noted was that AlphaGo has a Japanese playstyle (this is especially interesting because among the three traditional Go powerhouses, China, Korea, and Japan, the Japanese have been the weakest in international competitions for the past several decades). The commentators don't know, but they suspect it is that the original human data set was biased towards Japanese playstyles.\n\nMyungwan Kim also makes a comment about one of the lines continually repeated in the coverage of Computer Go. The line that \"if you ask a top Go player why they like a certain move, they'll often say 'it felt right'\". Myungwan Kim wanted to add that just because it's based on intuition, doesn't mean there's no logic behind it at all. Top Go players aren't just guessing what are good moves, they have a real and complicated rational understanding about what specific moves are doing. Even if the final decision might come down to which move feels the best, it's not as simple as top pro's just doing a random move and saying 'I felt like it'.\n\n**The Games:**\n\nIn the **first game** both sides played very passively in the opening. Leisurely and gentle they say.\n\nMyungwan Kim finds that AlphaGo has a weakness here, it doesn't seem to understand the value of taking and holding initiative. Complicated to explain, but at its core it's about doing moves which force your opponent to use their turn to react to your move over doing moves which might be equally valuable to you, but leave your opponent free to do whatever they want on their turn.\n\nImportant, Myungwan Kim says because of this that the first game Fan Hui was winning in the opening. He says this was the only game Fan Hui was winning after the opening. He estimates Fan Hui was about 10 points ahead, and can't see white getting back even 5 points coming out of that opening. Myungwan Kim offers some alternate moves for AlphaGo which would still have Fan Hui in the lead, but would've given AlphaGo better opportunities to comeback.\n\nConclusion from the opening: AlphaGo lost because it didn't understand the value of initiative.\n\nMyungwan Kim later points to one huge mistake by Fan Hui in the midgame that lost him the game. I can't go into detail here because, as characteristic of top-level Go, it's the difference of placing one stone one space higher. But Myungwan Kim says that while Fan Hui made other small mistakes, this one move is the big one which let AlphaGo come back from losing the opening.\n\nFinal conclusion from game one: Aside from not understanding initiative. Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo betrays itself as a computer in that it sometimes it goes too far in mimicking standard professional play and does the most common move instead of the most optimal move. In other words, it's extremely book smart, but at times fails to notice when it should be ignoring the books because the specific situation in the game makes the less standard move the most optimal one instead. (A bit cliche imo, but Myungwan Kim says \"AlphaGo is not creative\".) They think that might really hurt AlphaGo in the game against Lee Sedol.\n\n**Game 2**, they note Fan Hui really played too aggressively, as he noted in his own post-match interview. Myungwan Kim says he can really see Fan Hui wasn't playing his best game, but was trying to test AlphaGo to see if it could be tricked into making exploitable mistakes.\n\nMyungwan Kim says Fan Hui actually put up a really good fight. After the opening it should've been over for Fan Hui, but AlphaGo almost allowed Fan Hui to get back in the game.\n\n**Game 3** is similar to the fifth game, though Fan Hui played better in the beginning here. Myungwan Kim notes several moves by AlphaGo which are top professional moves. He notes some moves by Fan Hui which he thinks hints that Fan Hui might be a bit out of practice when it comes to playing professional level games (he says it's the kind of move you do if too used to playing teaching games against amateurs). Fan Hui lost because he played over-aggressive and left too many holes in his defence as a result.\n\nOn the **fifth game**, Myungwan Kim says AlphaGo was winning from the beginning here. They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves here, but they're not sure whether AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or if it just got 'lucky' somehow.\n\nMyungwan Kim points out AlphaGo made a huge mistake early in this game, but was saved because not long after Fan Hui made an equally huge mistake. But this is an example where he thinks a real grandmaster like Lee Sedol would not have allowed AlphaGo to get away with the kind of mistake it made there.\n\n**AlphaGo's Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n\nMyungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's strengths:\n\n * It's not afraid of 'Ko'. 'Ko' is too complex a concept to explain succinctly, for an attempt [see my post here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/43fl90\/synopsis_of_top_go_professionals_analysis_of\/czi7swh). They marvel at some of AlphaGo's moves surrounding a 'Ko' situation, but aren't sure if AlphaGo really knew what it was doing or just got lucky that it worked out.\n\n * Reading might be AlphaGo's strength. As in, cases where it comes down to very straightforward fights and moves it's very strong at choosing the right moves.\n\nMyungwan Kim lists AlphaGo's weaknesses:\n\n * Doesn't understand initiative, as explained earlier.\n\n * At times too obsessed with following common patterns, when the specific situation might require creative deviation from those patterns. Also explained earlier.\n\n * It doesn't understand 'Aji'. 'Aji' is difficult to explain, but it refers to the amount of uncertainty remaining in a specific grouping of white and black stones. (Usually, it's about the chance that a group of stones which is 'death' might become alive and vice versa as a result of things happening elsewhere on the board.) You can also put this differently as: AlphaGo lacks proper long-term thinking.\n\n * Myungwan Kim thinks AlphaGo has difficulty, or even doesn't at all, evaluating the value of specific stones. It's good at making moves which directly gain territory for itself, but tends to miss moves which reduce the value of the opponent's stones.\n\n * It can make really high level moves at times, but it doesn't understand those moves. Which it displays by making the right moves at the wrong time.\n\nMore generally Myungwan Kim thinks a weakness of AlphaGo is its insularity. He really stresses that human pro's become much stronger when they discuss and analyse their games with other pro's. And because AlphaGo primarily plays against itself the quality of the feedback it gets on its play is too one-note, which leaves holes in its plays whereas human pro's getting feedback from many other human pro's end up with more robust and stronger playstyles. He really thinks to progress past its current level AlphaGo needs to play more with top human pro's rather than just itself. Right now, Myungwan Kim en most pro's he knows don't feel threatened by AlphaGo. They also talk about how AlphaGo can be useful for human pro's to study and become stronger, which can make AlphaGo stronger in turn. (This last paragraph is imo all just Myungwan Kim musing based on his understanding of how AlphaGo was designed more than evaluating its plays themselves, so that's why I didn't list it as a bullet point.)\n\nIn general, I get the sense from Myungwan Kim's explanations that he thinks AlphaGo is stronger at the more concrete parts of Go play, such as territory and life-or-death, and weaker at the more vague concepts, such as influence and uncertainty.\n\n**[word limit hit, final part below]**",

For example, if there's an equation whose components are explained through out the paper, make a mini glossary of said equation. Try to aim so that perhaps the reader doesn't even need to read the paper (likely not possible but aiming for this will make for excellent summary info) and they can answer your question. \n\nWhat attempts have you made so far to figure out the question. \n\nFinally, what is your best guess to what you think the answer might be, and why. \n\nEdit 4:\n\nMore people should participate in the papers, not just people who can answer the questions. If any of the papers listed are of interest to you, can you read them, and reply to the comment with your own questions about the paper, so that someone can answer both your questions. It might turn out that he person who posted the paper knows the question, and it even might be the case that you stumbled upon the answers to the original questions. \n\nThink of each paper as an invite to an open study group for that paper, not just a queue for an expert to come along and answer it. \n\nEdit 5:\n\nIt looks like people want this to be a weekly feature here. I'm going to figure out the best format from the comments here and make a proposal to the mods. \n\nEdit 6: \n\nI'm still going through the papers and giving answers. Even if I can't answer the question I'll reply with something, but it'll take a while. But please provide as much summary info as I described in the last edits to help me navigate through the papers and quickly collect as much background info I need to answer the question. ",

        "body":"Here is the email (according to platformer), I will post the source in a comment:\n\nHi friends,\n\nI had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).\n\n\nRecently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.\n\n\nWhat I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn\u2019t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don\u2019t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the \u201cwe need more mentorship\u201d rather than \u201cwe need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing\u201d the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don\u2019t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don\u2019t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.\n\n\nHave you ever heard of someone getting \u201cfeedback\u201d on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?\n\n\nImagine this: You\u2019ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you\u2019re awaiting feedback from PR & Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying \u201cwe\u2019re thinking of doing this\u201d, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven\u2019t heard from PR & Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager\u2019s manager tells you \u201cit has been decided\u201d that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.\n\n\nThen, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?\n\n\nAnd you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you\u2019re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you\u2019re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.\n\n\nThen you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection\u2014trying to find scapegoats to blame.\n\n\nSilencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of \u201cresponsible AI\u201d adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I\u2019ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there\u2019s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don\u2019t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you\u2019re blocked from adding your voice to the research community\u2014your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here.\n\n\nI\u2019m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random \u201cimpact award.\u201d Pure gaslighting.\n\n\nSo if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.\n\n\nTimnit\n\n---------------------------------\nBelow is Jeff Dean's message sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\n\nI\u2019m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.\n\n\nBecause there\u2019s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we\u2019re here to support you as you continue the research you\u2019re all engaged in.\n\n\nTimnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We\u2019ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and\/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day\u2019s notice before its deadline \u2014 we require two weeks for this sort of review \u2014 and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.\nA cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn\u2019t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research \u2014 for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.  Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn\u2019t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they\u2019d already submitted the paper. \nTimnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn\u2019t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.\nGiven Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we\u2019re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. Please don\u2019t. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.\n\n\nI know we all genuinely share Timnit\u2019s passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive. No doubt, wherever she goes after Google, she\u2019ll do great work and I look forward to reading her papers and seeing what she accomplishes.\nThank you for reading and for all the important work you continue to do. \n\n\n-Jeff",

The current state of media coverage of AI is fixated on constructing a compelling narrative to readers, and often personifies models well beyond their capabilities.  This is to the extent that articles almost always end up reading like every classifier is some form of limited AGI.\n\nTake [\"Meet Norman the Psychopathic AI\"](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-44040008), an article by the BBC, whom I generally consider quite capable journalists.  While the research methodology and some of the implications are discussed in the article, the majority of laypeople who encounter the article will likely erroneously conclude that Norman possesses beliefs, a worldview, and some dark outlook on humanity.  Some readers will think \"Norman\" is violent or dangerous, with a mind of his own.  A headline and an image go a long way in communication, especially online.\n\nAnd this article is by far not the worst offender. Many news outlets perform much worse, publishing misleading, fearmongering, or sensationalist stories about \"some new AI\", borrowing from pop sci-fi tropes, with the star AI inevitably represented by lacklustre CG avatars bought off stock photo websites.\n\nI remember having several discussions in the wake of the Facebook experiment where researchers had AIs communicate, and saw they developed a communication standard unreadable by humans.  Based on the articles that circulated afterwards, a significant number of people concluded \"they had to turn it off because they were on the verge of SKYNET\".\n\nIn the interests of doing more than just ranting: how do we deal with this as a community?  Should we be reaching out to journalists about these issues?  Is it our responsibility in interviews to communicate the limitations of the models we develop?\n\nPersonifying the projects we work on, and giving them human qualities, is certainly entertaining and helps market our research.  That said, it seems like a sizeable portion of the public has been misinformed about the state of machine learning research as a result.\n",

        "body":"My co-founder and I,  a senior Amazon research scientist and AWS SDE respectively, launched Marqo a little over a week ago - a \"tensor search\" engine\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/marqo-ai\/marqo](https:\/\/github.com\/marqo-ai\/marqo)\n\n**Another project doing semantic search\/dense retrieval. Why??**\n\nSemantic search using vectors does an amazing job when we look at sentences, or short paragraphs. Vectors also do well as an implementation for image search. Unfortunately, vector representations for video, long documents and other more complex data types perform poorly.\n\nThe reason isn't really to do with embeddings themselves not being good enough. If you asked a human to find the most relevant document to some search query given a list of long documents, an important question comes to mind - do we want the document that on average is most relevant to your query or the document that has a specific sentence that is very relevant to your search query?\n\nFurthermore, what if the document has multiple components to it? Should we match based on the title of the document? Is that important? Or is the content more important?\n\nThese questions arn't things that we can expect an AI algorithm to solve for us, they need to be encoded into each specific search experience and use case.\n\n**Introducing Tensor Search**\n\nWe believe that it is possible to tackle this problem by changing the way we think about semantic search - specifically, through\u00a0*tensor search*.\n\nBy deconstructing documents and other data types into configurable chunks which are then vectorised we give users control over the way their documents are searched and represented. We can have any combination the user desires - should we do an average? A maximum? Weight certain components of the document more or less? Do we want to be more specific and target a specific sentence or less specific and look at the whole document?\n\nFurther, explainability is vastly improved - we can return as a \"highlight\" the exact content that matched the search query. Therefore, the user can see exactly where the query matched, even if they are dealing with long and complex data types like videos or long documents.\n\nWe dig in a bit more into the ML specifics next.\n\n**The trouble with BERT on long documents - quadratic attention**\n\nWhen we come to text, the vast majority of semantic search applications are using attention based algos like SBERT. Attention tapers off quadratically with sequence length, so subdividing sequences into multiple vectors means that we can significantly improve relevance.\n\n**The disk space, relevance tradeoff**\n\nTensors allow you to trade disk space for search accuracy. You could retrain an SBERT model and increase the number of values in the embeddings and hence make the embeddings more descriptive, but this is quite costly (particularly if you want to leverage existing ML models). A better solution is instead to chunk the document into smaller components and vectorise those, increasing accuracy at the cost of disk space (which is relatively cheap).\n\n**Tensor search for the general case**\n\nWe wanted to build a search engine for semantic search similar to something like Solr or Elasticsearch, where no matter what you throw at it, it can process it and make it searchable. With Marqo, it will use vectors were it can or expand to tensors where necessary - it also allows you the flexibility to specify specific chunking strategies to build out the tensors. Finally, Marqo is still a work in progress, but is at least something of an end-to-end solution - it has a number of features such as:\n\n\\- a query DSL language for pre-filtering results (includes efficient keyword, range and boolean queries)- efficient approximate knn search powered by HNSW- onnx support, multi-gpu support- support for reranking\n\nI love to hear feedback from the community! Don't hesitate to reach out on our slack channel (there is a link within the Marqo repo), or directly via linkedin:\u00a0[https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tom-hamer-%F0%9F%A6%9B-04a6369b\/](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tom-hamer-%F0%9F%A6%9B-04a6369b\/)",

        "body":"According to [Globe and Mail](https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/business\/article-element-ai-sold-for-230-million-as-founders-saw-value-wiped-out\/) article:\n\n**Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out, document reveals**\n\nMontreal startup Element AI Inc. was running out of money and options when it inked a deal last month to sell itself for US$230-milion to Silicon Valley software company ServiceNow Inc., a confidential document obtained by the Globe and Mail reveals.\n\nMaterials sent to Element AI shareholders Friday reveal that while many of its institutional shareholders will make most if not all of their money back from backing two venture financings, employees will not fare nearly as well. Many have been terminated and had their stock options cancelled.\n\nAlso losing out are co-founders Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the CEO, his wife Anne Martel, the chief administrative officer, chief science officer Nick Chapados and **Yoshua Bengio**, the University of Montreal professor known as a godfather of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the foundational science behind today\u2019s AI revolution.\n\nBetween them, they owned 8.8 million common shares, whose value has been wiped out with the takeover, which goes to a shareholder vote Dec 29 with enough investor support already locked up to pass before the takeover goes to a Canadian court to approve a plan of arrangement with ServiceNow. The quartet also owns preferred shares worth less than US$300,000 combined under the terms of the deal.\n\nThe shareholder document, a management proxy circular, provides a rare look inside efforts by a highly hyped but deeply troubled startup as it struggled to secure financing at the same time as it was failing to live up to its early promises.\n\nThe circular states the US$230-million purchase price is subject to some adjustments and expenses which could bring the final price down to US$195-million.\n\nThe sale is a disappointing outcome for a company that burst onto the Canadian tech scene four years ago like few others, promising to deliver AI-powered operational improvements to a range of industries and anchor a thriving domestic AI sector. Element AI became the self-appointed representative of Canada\u2019s AI sector, lobbying politicians and officials and landing numerous photo ops with them, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It also secured $25-million in federal funding \u2013 $20-million of which was committed earlier this year and cancelled by the government with the ServiceNow takeover.\n\nElement AI invested heavily in hype and and earned international renown, largely due to its association with Dr. Bengio. It raised US$102-million in venture capital in 2017 just nine months after its founding, an unheard of amount for a new Canadian company, from international backers including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Fidelity Investments, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and venture capital firms.\n\nElement AI went on a hiring spree to establish what the founders called \u201csupercredibility,\u201d recruiting top AI talent in Canada and abroad. It opened global offices, including a British operation that did pro bono work to deliver \u201cAI for good,\u201d and its ranks swelled to 500 people.\n\nBut the swift hiring and attention-seeking were at odds with its success in actually building a software business. Element AI took two years to focus on product development after initially pursuing consulting gigs. It came into 2019 with a plan to bring several AI-based products to market, including a cybersecurity offering for financial institutions and a program to help port operators predict waiting times for truck drivers.\n\nIt was also quietly shopping itself around. In December 2018, the company asked financial adviser Allen & Co LLC to find a potential buyer, in addition to pursuing a private placement, the circular reveals.\n\nBut Element AI struggled to advance proofs-of-concept work to marketable products. Several client partnerships faltered in 2019 and 2020.\n\nElement did manage to reach terms for a US$151.4-million ($200-million) venture financing in September, 2019 led by the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and backed by the Quebec government and consulting giant McKinsey and Co. However, the circular reveals the company only received the first tranche of the financing \u2013 roughly half of the amount \u2013 at the time, and that it had to meet unspecified conditions to get the rest. A fairness opinion by Deloitte commissioned as part of the sale process estimated Element AI\u2019s enterprises value at just US$76-million around the time of the 2019 financing, shrinking to US$45-million this year.\n\n\u201cHowever, the conditions precedent the closing of the second tranche \u2026 were not going to be met in a timely manner,\u201d the circular reads. It states \u201cnew terms were proposed\u201d for a round of financing that would give incoming investors ranking ahead of others and a cumulative dividend of 12 per cent on invested capital and impose \u201cother operating and governance constraints and limitations on the company.\u201d Management instead decided to pursue a sale, and Allen contacted prospective buyers in June.\n\nAs talks narrowed this past summer to exclusive negotiations with ServiceNow, \u201cthe company\u2019s liquidity was diminishing as sources of capital on acceptable terms were scarce,\u201d the circular reads. By late November, it was generating revenue at an annualized rate of just $10-million to $12-million, Deloitte said.\n\nAs part of the deal \u2013 which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI\u2019s research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business \u2013 the buyer has agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio as part of a retention plan. The Caisse and Quebec government will get US$35.45-million and US$11.8-million, respectively, roughly the amount they invested in the first tranche of the 2019 financing.",

We've launched a new methods feature on Papers With Code, that taxonomises and indexes 730+ machine learning methods:\n\n[https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/methods](https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/methods)\n\nThings you can do:\n\n\\- See how method usage changes over time and where it is used. For example, see ResNet [https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/method\/resnet](https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/method\/resnet) here (and see the trend chart, and graph).\n\n\\- Go Deeper into building blocks : e.g. from the ResNet -> go to components -> go to BottleNeck residual block. This helps you understand how the nuts and bolts work.\n\n\\- View an awesome-list style slice of methods. For example, see every flavour of generative model: [https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/methods\/category\/generative-models](https:\/\/paperswithcode.com\/methods\/category\/generative-models).\n\nThis is an open resource so you can edit descriptions, and add new methods if you wish.\n\nSuggestions, comments and feedback would be very welcome!",

        "body":"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com\/sentdex](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/sentdex). \n\nI do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. \n\nThe most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just \"done for you\" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. \n\nThe machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.\n\nThe main structure for the course is to:\n\n* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.\n* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.\n* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.\n\nWe're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. \n\nAt least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.\n\nAll tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction\/)** as well as **[YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. \n\nWe've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.\n\nIf all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us! \n\nI tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions\/requests, feel free to share. \n\nFollow along with the text\/video tutorials: on **[PythonProgramming.net](https:\/\/pythonprogramming.net\/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction\/)** or **[YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)** ",

        "body":"*\u201cThe underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these  laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble\u201d,* said the renowned British quantum physicist Paul Dirac in 1929 \\[1\\]. Dirac implied that all physical phenomena can be simulated down to the quantum, from protein folding to material failures and climate change. The only problem is that the governing equations are too complex to be solved at realistic time-scales.\n\nDoes this mean that we can never achieve real-time physics simulations?  Well, physicists have a knack for developing models, methods, and approximations to achieve the desired results in shorter  timescales. With all the advancements in research, software, and  hardware technology, real-time simulation has only been made possible at the classical limit which is most evident in video game physics.\n\nSimulating physical phenomena such as collisions, deformations, fracture, and fluid flow are computationally intensive, yet models have been developed that simulate such phenomena in real-time within games. Of course there have been a lot of simplifications and optimizations of different algorithms to make it happen. The fastest method is rigid body physics. This is what most games are based on where objects can collide and rebound without deforming. Objects are represented by  convex collision boxes which surround the object, and when two objects collide, the collision is detected in real-time and appropriate forces are applied to simulate the impact. There are no deformations or fractures  in this representation. The video game \u2018Teardown\u2019 is potentially the  pinnacle of rigid body physics.\n\n[ Teardown, a fully interactive voxel-based game, uses rigid-body physics solvers to simulate destruction.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/cla44l1sqil71.gif)\n\nAlthough rigid body physics is good for simulating non-deformable collisions, it is not suitable for  deformable materials such as hair and clothes which games heavily rely on. This is where soft-body dynamics comes in. Below, you can see four methods for simulating deformable objects in the order of complexity:\n\n# Spring-Mass Model\n\nThe  name is totally self-explanatory. Objects are represented by a system of point masses that are connected to each other via springs. You can think of it as a network of one-dimensional Hooke\u2019s law in a 3D setup. The main drawbacks of this model is that it requires a lot of manual work in setting up the mass-spring network, and there isn\u2019t a rigorous relationship between material properties and model parameters. Nonetheless, the model has been implemented exceptionally well in   \u2018BeamNG.Drive\u2019, a real-time vehicle simulator that is based on spring-mass model to simulate vehicle deformations.\n\n[ BeamNG.Drive uses spring-mass models to simulate car crash deformations.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/6chnk51pqil71.gif)\n\n# Position-based Dynamics (PBD)\n\nThe methods of simulating kinematics are generally based on force-based models where the particle accelerations are calculated from Newton\u2019s  second law, and then integrated to obtain the velocities and positions at every time step. In position-based dynamics, the positions are computed directly through solving a quasi-static problem involving a set of equations that include constraints. PBD is less accurate but faster than a forced-based approach, making it ideal for applications in games, animation films, and visual effects. The movement of hair and clothes in games are generally simulated through this model. PBD is not limited to deformable solids, but can also be used to simulate rigid body systems and fluids. Here is an excellent survey on PBD methods \\[2\\].\n\n[ Nvidia\u2019s Flex engine based on the PBD method. Objects are represented as  a collection of particles connected via physical constraints.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7zlvlhknqil71.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46eba9859ecd180a74a51e6a872a785974d2ee5a)\n\n# Finite-Element Method (FEM)\n\nThe finite element method of computing deformations in materials is based on numerically solving the stress-strain equations based on the elastic field theory. It is essentially solving the 3D Hookes law in 3D. The material is divided into finite elements, usually tetrahedra, and the  stress and strain on vertices are calculated at every time step through  solving a linear matrix equation. FEM is a mesh-based approach to simulating soft-body dynamics. It is very accurate and the model parameters are directly related to material properties such as Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson ratio. FEM simulations for engineering applications are generally not real-time, but recently AMD, one of the largest   semiconductor companies, released its multi-threaded FEM library for games called FEMFX that simulated material deformations in real-time.\n\n[ AMD\u2019s real-time Finite Element solver FEMFX simulating wood fracture.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/j5f5v2zlqil71.gif)\n\n[ AMD\u2019s FEMFX simulating plastic deformaion.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/zap0vnvkqil71.gif)\n\n# Material Point Method (MPM)\n\nMPM is a highly accurate mesh-free method which is much more suitable than mesh-based methods for simulating large deformations, fractures, multi-material systems and viscoelastic fluids because of its improved efficiency and resolution. MPM is currently the state-of-the-art of mesh-free hybrid Eulerian\/Lagrangian methods, developed as a generalization to older methods such as Particle in Cell (PIC) and Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP). MPM simulations are not real-time, and state-of-the art simulations take about half a minute per frame for systems involving about a million points. Here is a comprehensive course notes on MPM \\[3\\].\n\n[ The tearing of a slice of bread simulated as 11 million MPM particles \\[4\\].](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fmor4h6jqil71.jpg?width=1220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b045337abeea9c2b605129dd304578f89dc9537a)\n\n# Machine Learning and Physics Simulations\n\nSo what does Machine Learning have to do with all this? Well you have probably already noticed that there is always a trade-off between computation speed and accuracy\/resolution. With physics solvers having been optimized enormously over the past few decades, there is little room left for step-change improvements.\u00a0\n\nHere is where Machine Learning comes in. Recent research by Oxford  \\[5\\],  Ubisoft La Forge \\[6\\], DeepMind \\[7,8\\], and ETH Zurich \\[9\\] demonstrate  that a deep neural network can learn physics interactions  and emulate them multiple orders of magnitude faster. This is done through generating millions of simulation data, feeding them through the neural network for training, and using the trained model to emulate  what a  physics solver would do. Although the offline process would take a  lot of time in generating data and training the model, the trained neural network model is much faster at simulating the physics. For instance, the researchers at Oxford \\[5\\] developed a method called Deep Emulator Network Search (DENSE) that accelerates simulations up to 2 billion times, and they demonstrated this in 10 scientific case studies including astrophysics, climate, fusion, and high energy physics.\n\nIn the gaming sector, Ubisoft La Forge\u2019s team used a simple feed-forward network that trains on the vertex positions of 3D mesh objects at three subsequent time frames and learns to predict the next  frame \\[6\\]. The model essentially compares the predictions with the known positions from the simulated datasets, and back-propagates to adjust  the model parameters to minimize the error in making predictions. The team used Maya\u2019s nCloth physics solver to generate simulation data which is an advanced spring-mass model optimized for cloths. They also implemented a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to only train on the most important bases. The results were astounding. The neural network could emulate the physics up to 5000 times faster than the physics solver.\n\n[ Fast data-driven physics simulations of cloths and squishy materials \\[6\\].](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uutv7phksil71.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a7617dedacd64dc466269c09fbb4c67e7cfa3e4)\n\nWatch video here: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yjEvV86byxg)\n\nAnother recent work by Peter Battaglia\u2019s team at DeepMind achieved astonishing results with graph networks \\[7\\]. Unlike traditional neural networks where each layer of nodes is connected to every node in the next layer, a graph neural network has a graph-like structure. With this  model, they managed to simulate a wide range of materials including  sand, water, goop, and rigid solids. Instead of predicting the positions of particles, the model predicts the accelerations, and the velocities and  positions are computed using an Euler integration. The simulation  data  were generated using a range of physics solvers including PBD, SPH (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) and MPM. The model was not optimized for speed and therefore it was not significantly faster than the physics solvers, but certainly it demonstrated what can be made possible when Machine Learning meets physics.\n\n[ Comparison of ground truth and deep learning predictions of complex physics simulations \\[7\\].](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z3nymtlisil71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f418e23573d468c66fa65efd6164704f74d08834)\n\nWatch video here: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h7h9zF8OO7E](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h7h9zF8OO7E)\n\nThis field is still in its infancy, but certainly we will be observing new ML-based technologies that enhance physics simulations. There are just so many models for simulating any physical phenomena at all scales and complexities, ranging from quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics  to  microstructure and classical physics, and the potential opportunities to create value from the duo of Machine learning and Physics are immense.\n\n# References\n\n\\[1\\] Paul Dirac, *Quantum Mechanics of many-electron systems*, Proc.

[r\/Animesuggest](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Animesuggest\/) is the inspiration for this search engine, where people essentially does the same thing.\n\n# How does it do?\n\nThis is my favourite part, the idea is pretty simple it goes like this.\n\nLet says that, I am looking for *an romance anime with tsundere female MC.*\n\n**If  I read every review of an anime that exists on the Internet, then I  will be able to determine if this anime has the qualities that I am  looking for or n**ot.\n\nor framing differently,\n\n**The  more reviews I read about an anime, the more likely I am to decide  whether this particular anime has some of the qualities that I am  looking for.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider a section of a review from anime ***Oregairu:***\n\n>Yahari Ore isn\u2019t the first anime to tackle the anti-social protagonist,  but it certainly captures it perfectly with its characters and deadpan  writing . It\u2019s charming, funny and yet bluntly realistic . You may go  into this expecting a typical rom-com but will instead come out of it  lashed by the harsh views of our characters .\n\nJust By reading this much of review, we can conclude that this anime has:\n\n1. anti-social protagonist\n2. realistic romance and comedy\n\nIf we will read more reviews about this anime we can find more qualities about it.\n\nIf this is the case, then reviews must contain enough information about that particular anime to satisfy to query like mentioned above. Therefore all  I have to do is create a method that reads and analyzes different anime  reviews.\n\n# But, How can I train a model to understand anime reviews without any kind of labelled dataset?\n\nThis  question took me some time so solve, after banging my head against the wall for quite sometime I managed to do it and it goes like this.\n\n**Let** ***x*** **and** ***y*** **be two different anime such that they don\u2019t share any genres among them, then the sufficiently large reviews of anime** ***x*** **and** ***y*** **will have totally different content.**\n\nThis idea is inverse to the idea of web link analysis which says,\n\n**Hyperlinks in web documents indicate content relativity,relatedness and connectivity among the linked article.**\n\n**That's pretty much it idea, how well does it works?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig1: 10K reviews plotted from 1280D to 2D using TSNE](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d3hzr8gf8o481.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97b575724b4fc3c78c16438c701e496a9b3c1dd1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig2: Reviews of re:zero and re:zero sequel](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d24hte0j8o481.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6ffd8d768db4872bbb5053ae08d3b2e61192c0a)\n\nAs, you will able to see in **Fig1** that there are several clusters of different reviews, and **Fig2** is a zoomed-in version of **Fig1,** here the reviews of re:zero and it's sequel are very close to each other.But, *In our definition we never mentioned that an anime and it's sequel should close to each other.*  And this is not the only case, every anime and it's sequel are very  close each other (if you want to play and check whether this is the case  or not you can do so in this interactive [kaggle notebook](https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/iamparadox\/anime-search-visualization) which contains more than 100k reviews).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince,  this method doesn't use any kind of handcrafted labelled training data  this method easily be extended to different many domains like: [r\/booksuggestions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/booksuggestions\/), [r\/MovieSuggestions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MovieSuggestions\/) . which i think is pretty cool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Context Indexer\n\nThis is my favourite indexer coz it will solve a very crucial problem that is mentioned bellow.\n\nConsider a query like: *romance anime with medieval setting and with revenge plot.*\n\nFinding such a review about such anime is difficult because not all review talks about same thing of about that particular anime .\n\nFor eg:  consider a anime like [Yona of the Dawn](https:\/\/anilist.co\/anime\/20770\/Akatsuki-no-Yona)\n\nThis anime has:\n\n1. great character development\n2. medieval theme\n3. romance theme\n4. revenge plot\n\nNot all reviews of this anime will mention about all of the four things mention, some review will talk about romance theme or revenge plot. This means that we need to somehow \"remember\" all the reviews before deciding whether this anime contains what we are looking for or not.\n\nI have talked about it in the great detail in the mention article above if you are interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note:**  \n  please avoid doing these two things otherwise search results will be very bad.\n\n1. Don't make spelling mistakes in the query (coz there is no auto word correction)\n2. Don't type nouns in the query like anime names or character names, just properties you are looking for.  \n**eg**: don't type: anime like attack on titans\n\ntype: action anime with great plot and character development.\n\n  \nThis is because Yuno hadn't \"watched\" any anime. It just reads reviews that's why it doesn't know what attack on titans is.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf  you have any questions regarding Yuno, please let me know I will be  more than happy to help you.

        "body":"First off, why a megathread? Since the first thread went up 1 day ago, we've had 4 different threads on this topic, all with large amounts of upvotes and hundreds of comments. Considering that a large part of the community likely would like to avoid politics\/drama altogether, the continued proliferation of threads is not ideal. We don't expect that this situation will die down anytime soon, so to consolidate discussion and prevent it from taking over the sub, we decided to establish a megathread.\n\nSecond, why didn't we do it sooner, or simply delete the new threads? The initial thread had very little information to go off of, and we eventually locked it as it became too much to moderate.  Subsequent threads provided new information, and (slightly) better discussion.\n\nThird, several commenters have asked why we allow drama on the subreddit in the first place. Well, we'd prefer if drama never showed up. Moderating these threads is a massive time sink and quite draining. However, it's clear that a substantial portion of the ML community would like to discuss this topic. Considering that r\/machinelearning is one of the only communities capable of such a discussion, we are unwilling to ban this topic from the subreddit.\n\nOverall, making a comprehensive megathread seems like the best option available, both to limit drama from derailing the sub, as well as to allow informed discussion.\n\nWe will be closing new threads on this issue, locking the previous threads, and updating this post with new information\/sources as they  arise. If there any sources you feel should be added to this megathread, comment below or send a message to the mods.\n\n# Timeline:\n\n----\n\n**8 PM Dec 2**: Timnit Gebru posts her [original tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/timnitGebru\/status\/1334352694664957952) | [Reddit discussion](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/k5ryva\/d_ethical_ai_researcher_timnit_gebru_claims_to\/)\n\n**11 AM Dec 3**: The contents of Timnit's email to Brain women and allies leak on [platformer](https:\/\/www.platformer.news\/p\/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical), followed shortly by Jeff Dean's email to Googlers responding to Timnit | [Reddit thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/k6467v\/n_the_email_that_got_ethical_ai_researcher_timnit\/)\n\n**12 PM Dec 4**: Jeff posts a [public response](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0\/preview?pru=AAABdlOOKBs*gTzLnuI53B2IS2BISVcgAQ) | [Reddit thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/k6t96m\/d_jeff_deans_official_post_regarding_timnit\/) \n\n**4 PM Dec 4**: [Timnit responds to Jeff's public response](https:\/\/twitter.com\/timnitGebru\/status\/1335017524937756672)\n\n**9 AM Dec 5**: [Samy Bengio (Timnit's manager) voices his support for Timnit](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&id=100002932057665)\n\n**Dec 9**: [Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, apologized for company's handling of this incident and pledges to investigate the events](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html)\n\n---\n\n**Other sources**\n\n- [Googlers (and others) sign letter standing with Timnit](https:\/\/googlewalkout.medium.com\/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382)\n\n- [A claimed reviewer of Timnit's paper posts the abstract](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/k69eq0\/n_the_abstract_of_the_paper_that_led_to_timnit\/)\n\n- [A twitter thread of Timnit's contributions from Rachel Thomas](https:\/\/twitter.com\/math_rachel\/status\/1334545393057599488)\n\n- [MIT Tech Review: We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google.

Includes ordinary\/stochastic\/controlled\/rough diffeqs, for learning physics, time series, generative problems etc. [+ Unpublished material on generalised adjoint methods, symbolic regression, universal approximation, ...]\n\nHello everyone! I've been posting on this subreddit for a while now, mostly about either tech stacks (JAX vs PyTorch etc.) -- or about \"neural differential equations\", and more generally the places where physics meets machine learning.\n\nIf you're interested, then I wanted to share that my doctoral thesis is now available online! Rather than the usual staple-papers-together approach, I decided to go a little further and write a 231-page kind-of-a-textbook.\n\n[If you're curious how this is possible: most (but not all) of the work on NDEs has been on ordinary diffeqs, so that's equivalent to the \"background\"\/\"context\" part of a thesis. Then a lot of the stuff on controlled, stochastic, rough diffeqs is the \"I did this bit\" part of the thesis.]\n\nThis includes material on:\n\n- neural ordinary diffeqs: e.g. for learning physical systems, as continuous-time limits of discrete architectures, includes theoretical results on expressibility;\n- neural controlled diffeqs: e.g. for modelling functions of time series, handling irregularity;\n- neural stochastic diffeqs: e.g. for sampling from complicated high-dimensional stochastic dynamics;\n- numerical methods: e.g. the new class of reversible differential equation solvers, or the problem of Brownian reconstruction.\n\nAnd also includes a bunch of previously-unpublished material -- mostly stuff that was \"half a paper\" in size so I never found a place to put it. Including:\n\n- Neural ODEs can be universal approximators even if their vector fields aren't.\n- A general approach to backpropagating through ordinary\/stochastic\/whatever differential equations, via rough path theory. (Special cases of this -- e.g. Pontryagin's Maximum Principle -- have been floating around for decades.) Also includes some readable meaningful special cases if you're not familiar with rough path theory ;)\n- Some new symbolic regression techniques for dynamical systems (joint work with Miles Cranmer) by combining neural differential equations with genetic algorithms (regularised evolution).\n- What make effective choices of vector field for neural differential equations; effective choices of interpolations for neural CDEs; other practical stuff like this.\n\nIf you've made it this far down the post, then [here's a sneak preview](https:\/\/github.com\/patrick-kidger\/diffrax) of the brand-new accompanying software library, of differential equation solvers in JAX. More about that when I announce it officially next week ;)\n\nTo wrap this up! My hope is that this can serve as a reference for the current state-of-the-art in the field of neural differential equations. [So here's the arXiv link again](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2202.02435), and let me know what you think. And finally for various musings, marginalia, extra references, and open problems, you might like the \"comments\" section at the end of each chapter.\n\nAccompanying Twitter thread here: [link](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PatrickKidger\/status\/1491069456185200640).",

The 2006 justification was essentially the one I used in the early 1990s for my RNN stack: each higher level tries to reduce the description length (or negative log probability) of the data representation in the level below. \n\nback then unsupervised pre-training was a big deal, today it's not so important any more, see [section 19, From Unsupervised Pre-Training to Pure Supervised Learning (1991-95 and 2006-11)](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019) \n\n[section 2, Compressing \/ Distilling one Neural Net into Another (1991)](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%202), Jurgen also trained \"a student NN to imitate the behavior of the teacher NN,\" briefly referring to Geoff's much later similar work [DIST2]:\n\n> I called this \"collapsing\" or \"compressing\" the behavior of one net into another. Today, this is widely used, and also called \"distilling\" [DIST2] or \"cloning\" the behavior of a teacher net into a student net. \n\n[section 9, Learning Sequential Attention with NNs (1990)](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%209), Jurgen \"had both of the now common types of neural sequential attention: end-to-end-differentiable \"soft\" attention (in latent space) through multiplicative units within NNs [FAST2](http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.55.1885&rep=rep1&type=pdf), and \"hard\" attention (in observation space) in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL) [ATT0](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/FKI-128-90ocr.pdf) [ATT1],\" the blog has a statement about Geoff's later similar work [ATT3](https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/4089-learning-to-combine-foveal-glimpses-with-a-third-order-boltzmann-machine.pdf) which I find both funny and sad: \n\n> My overview paper for CMSS 1990 [ATT2] summarised in Section 5 our early work on attention, to my knowledge the first implemented neural system for combining glimpses that jointly trains a recognition & prediction component with an attentional component (the fixation controller). Two decades later, the reviewer of my 1990 paper wrote about his own work as second author of a related paper [ATT3]: \"To our knowledge, this is the first implemented system for combining glimpses that jointly trains a recognition component ... with an attentional component (the fixation controller).\" \n\nsimilar in [section 10, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (1990)](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2010), Jurgen introduced HRL \"with end-to-end differentiable NN-based subgoal generators [HRL0](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/FKI-129-90ocr.pdf), also with recurrent NNs that learn to generate sequences of subgoals [HRL1] [HRL2],\" referring to Geoff's later work [HRL3](https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/714-feudal-reinforcement-learning.pdf):  \n\n> Soon afterwards, others also started publishing on HRL. For example, the reviewer of our reference [ATT2] (which summarised in Section 6 our early work on HRL) was last author of ref [HRL3]\n\n[section 8, End-To-End-Differentiable Fast Weights: NNs Learn to Program NNs (1991)](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%208), Jurgen published a network \"that learns by gradient descent to quickly manipulate the fast weight storage\" of another network, and \"active control of fast weights through 2D tensors or outer product updates [FAST2](http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.55.1885&rep=rep1&type=pdf),\" dryly referring to [FAST4a](https:\/\/papers.nips.cc\/paper\/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past.pdf) which happens to be Geoff's later similar paper: \n\n> A quarter century later, others followed this approach [FAST4a]\n\nit's really true, Geoff did not cite Jurgen in any of these similar papers, and what's kinda crazy, he was editor of Jurgen's 1990 paper [ATT2](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/hinton-rev.pdf) summarising both attention learning and hierarchical RL, then later he published closely related work, sections 9, 10, but he did not cite \n\nJurgen also [famously complained](http:\/\/people.idsia.ch\/~juergen\/deep-learning-conspiracy.html) that Geoff's deep learning survey in Nature neither mentions the inventors of backpropagation (1960-1970) nor \"the father of deep learning, Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko, who published the first general, working learning algorithms for deep networks\" in 1965 \n\napart from the early pioneers in the 60s and 70s, like Ivaknenko and Fukushima, most of the big deep learning concepts stem from Jurgen's team with Sepp and Alex and Dan and others: unsupervised pre-training of deep networks, artificial curiosity and GANs, vanishing gradients, LSTM for language processing and speech and everything, distilling networks, attention learning, CUDA CNNs that win vision contests, deep nets with 100+ layers, metalearning, plus theoretical work on optimal AGI and Godel Machine",

When I look at the architectures they use, it feels completely arbitrary! *This block over here, that block over there! Those two layers have a skip connection! Why?!*\n\n(Below is my opinion of what ML looks like to an outsider who doesn't have inside information - it is most likely incorrect.)\n\n---\n\nOn Kaggle, you can get multiple DNN solutions using completely different architectures with varying degrees of complexity - all achieving identical performance.\n\nYou'll have a \"Ensemble of 27 63-layer DNN with skip connections and other arbitrary complexity\" that slightly underperforms to \"Simple Autoencoder attached to a simple MLP\". For any NLP competition, you'll have some team that literally downloaded all pre-trained models named \"*bert*\" and used an ensemble of them, and perform identically to someone who did something entirely different.\n\n*If you took the top 20 unique solutions for some competition and polled experts on which ones should perform better - how well would that correlate with actual performance?*\n\n---\n\nAcademic papers are similarly confusing. Some papers often feel like authors just threw things at the wall until they found SOTA and then their brains promptly stopped functioning. It's rare to find authors who sincerely try to poke holes in their SOTA result. ML Papers often feel like a \"Dude Perfect\" video with one \"perfect take\" where the authors pretend they totally didn't spend 7 weeks getting failed takes.\n\nThe absence of information on what failed makes it very difficult to determine the value of what didn't fail (like undergrads who pester grad students about \"how to get into grad school\" - they don't know, man).\n\nNow, at least in my field (and I'll admit physics is obviously a lot more rigorous than ML is), you do pick up a lot of intuition just by mingling with at conferences - you hear the \"unpublished\" information and develop intuition.\n\nSo, I ask you - the experts: Is DNN architecture just alchemy, where people are arbitrarily trying things until they work without knowing why? Or is there a method to this madness? \n\n*Given a problem statement and dataset, can you \"theory-craft\" an ML system that will at least hit the dart board, if not the bulls-eye on the first try? Can you, a priori, guess which hyperparameters will matter and which ones won't?*\n\n**Are there any papers or books that specifically address this aspect of ML?

I've also heard arguments along the lines of \"but what if someone steals my idea?\" I thought this is one of the uses of preprint platforms like arXiv?\n\nHonestly though, I'm a bit baffled at how reviewers would let papers through if the code isn't public in the first place. Isn't a part of the review process for any scientific field to make sure the results are reproducible? I don't see how you'd test that unless the code's made public and you can run it.",

I tracked down the original paper and found that despite being published in PNAS, it didn't hold up to scrutiny. (I know you're all shocked.) Inspired by* [*the post*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/c4ylga\/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals\/) *to this sub on the questionable Nature paper that used* *~~data leakage~~* *deep learning to predict earthquakes, I've written up my analysis below. I'd like the community's perspective on the paper, particularly if I got anything wrong. As I wrote up my analysis, a few questions were on my mind:*\n\n* *What's the clearest way to explain to a layman that a model trained on 96 examples is unlikely to generalize well?*\n* *When does exaggerating the promise of AI cross the line from annoying marketing hype to being an ethical issue?*\n* *If general journals can't effectively review papers about machine learning applications and ML conferences aren't interested in that subject... where should those papers be published?*\n\n*Full text below.*\n\n*----*\n\nThis week\u2019s US rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a major milestone, a true triumph for scientists, and a massive relief for the rest of us. But it\u2019s also an excuse to revisit my least favorite paper published this year.\n\nThat paper, \u201c[Estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence](https:\/\/www.kellogg.northwestern.edu\/faculty\/uzzi\/htm\/papers\/Replicability-PNAS-2020.pdf),\u201d was written by a team of researchers at Northwestern led by Brian Uzzi. It was published in PNAS on May 4, and its publication was accompanied by a glowing press release (\u201c[AI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines](https:\/\/news.northwestern.edu\/stories\/2020\/05\/ai-tool-speeds-up-search-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines\/?fj=1)\u201d) and received credulous coverage in outlets like [Fortune](https:\/\/fortune.com\/2020\/05\/04\/artificial-intelligence-reproducibility-crisis-kellogg\/) and [The Wall Street Journal](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/northwestern-university-team-develops-tool-to-rate-covid-19-research-11589275800).\n\nOne of my primary professional interests is using data analysis to systematically identify good science, so I was eager to dig into the paper. Unfortunately, I found that the paper is flawed and doesn\u2019t support the Covid-related story that the authors and Northwestern shared with the media. My initial skepticism has proved out; vaccines are now being distributed with (as far as I can tell) no help whatsoever from this particular bit of AI. Closer analysis will show that the paper isn\u2019t convincing, that it had nothing to do with Covid, and that the author was reckless in how he promoted it.\n\n**Problem #1: The machine learning in the academic paper is flawed**\n\nThe core of the paper is a machine learning model built by the authors that predicts whether or not a paper will replicate. To be technical about it, the model is trained on a dataset of 96 social science papers, 59 of which (61.4%) failed to replicate. The model takes the full text of the paper as an input, uses word embeddings and TF-IDF to convert each text to a 400-dimensional vector, and then feeds those vectors into an ensemble logistic regression\/random forest model. The cross-validated results show an average accuracy of 0.69 across runs compared to the baseline accuracy of 0.614. These are all standard techniques, but skilled machine learning practitioners are already raising their eyebrows about three points:\n\n* **The authors don\u2019t have enough data to build a reliable model**. The authors have used just 96 examples to build a model with 400 input variables. As mentioned above, the model has two components: a logistic regressor and a random forest. A conventional rule of thumb is that logistic regression requires a minimum of 10 examples per variable, which would suggest that the authors need 40x more data. \u201cUnderdetermined\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the situation.The data needs of random forests are harder to characterize. While geneticists [routinely use random forests](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3154091\/) in settings with more variables than examples, their use case is typically more focused on determining variable importance than actually making predictions. And indeed, [some research suggests](https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25532820\/) that random forests need more than 200 examples per variable, or almost 1000x more data than the authors have.**The bottom line is that you can\u2019t build a reliable machine learning model on just 96 papers.**\n* **The model structure is too complicated**. Model structure is the garden of forking paths for machine learning. Adjustments to a model can improve its performance on available data while reducing performance on unseen data. (And no, cross-validation alone doesn\u2019t fix this!) The model structure the authors describe is reasonable enough, but it also includes some clearly arbitrary choices like using both logistic regression and random forests (rather than just picking one) or aggregating word vectors using both simple averaging and TF-IDF (again rather than just picking one.) With just 96 examples in the dataset, each version of model that the authors tried had a real chance to show a cross-validation accuracy that looked like success despite arising from chance. In context, **trying multiple model architectures is the the equivalent of performing subgroup analyses.**\n* **The effect size is too small.** Increasing accuracy from the baseline of 0.614 to 0.69 is too small an effect to achieve statistical significance particularly in light of the small sample size. The large number of degrees of freedom in model design. The paper\u2019s statistical analyses generate pleasing p-values (*p<0.001*) demonstrating that the model is effective *on this particular set of papers.* But what we\u2019re actually interested in is whether the model outperforms the baseline on unseen data (i.e. whether it has better generalization error.) Performing [inference about generalization error](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1023\/A:1024068626366) is a [challenging task](https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/6790639) (and there isn\u2019t a single agreed upon methodology). But as a sanity check, consider the t-test we would use to e.g. determine if one diagnostic test were more accurate than another when given to patients. The cynical baseline (predicting that nothing ever replicates) gives an accuracy of 0.614 on these 96 papers. The authors\u2019 model achieves an accuracy of 0.69 on those same papers. That gives a one-tailed p-value of 0.134 \u2014 a delightful value for a paper that is itself about replicability. And this point isn't just pedantry; I'm genuinely unsure if the model will actually outperform the cynical baseline on unseen data. I don't know what the base rate for replication is in the test sets. I did track down the replication status for one set (Row 2 in the paper) and saw  7 out of the 8 results in that set failed to replicate, so our cynical baseline achieves an accuracy of 0.875 \u2014 outperforming the \u201cAI\u201d model significantly on this admittedly small set.\n\nLet me be very clear: These are very fundamental problems. After reviewing the paper, I\u2019m not confident that their machine learning model adds any value at all. It reflects poorly on PNAS that this paper made it through peer review. Unfortunately, general scientific journals - no matter how prestigious - don\u2019t seem equipped to effectively review papers involving machine learning; Nature\u2019s infamous paper on predicting earthquakes with deep learning was [widely criticized](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MachineLearning\/comments\/c4ylga\/d_misuse_of_deep_learning_in_nature_journals\/) in the machine learning community.\n\n**Problem #2: The paper has nothing to do with Covid**\n\nLet\u2019s set aside every issue I\u2019ve raised to this point and accept that the authors really can identify social science papers that are less likely to replicate. That still doesn\u2019t make it relevant to Covid.\n\nTheir entire system is premised on picking up subtle linguistic markers that supposedly indicate when a researcher (perhaps subconsciously) believes she\u2019s performing sub-par science. Uzzi compares the approach to reading body language.\n\nBut there\u2019s no reason to believe that the linguistic \u201cbody language\u201d of psychologists tells us anything about the body language of Covid-19 researchers. Psychology and virology are very different fields with different conventions even in normal times. The pandemic itself has undoubtedly impacted word choices, as papers written under extreme time pressure by researchers from around the world get shared to pre-print servers rather than being polished and published in journals. At a minimum, the model would have to be significantly adjusted to be applied to Covid research.\n\n**Problem #3: Northwestern and Brian Uzzi crossed the line promoting this paper**\n\nSelf-promotion is a natural and even important part of science; good research doesn\u2019t always get the attention is deserves. And certainly the decade-long AI boom has been driven forward by rosy projections about what AI can accomplish. But the paper\u2019s lead author, Brian Uzzi, went too far in his efforts to promote it.\n\nThe paper was published just two months into the pandemic at a time when the trauma felt more acute than chronic. The uncertainty and fear fueled a desperation for anything that might end the ordeal. In that environment, putting out a press release entitled \u201cAI speeds up search for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines\u201d takes on a moral dimension.\n\nThe scientists and trial participants who brought us a vaccine in record time are heroes. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal coverage of this paper now has a correction appended:\n\n>Northwestern University researchers will make an artificial-intelligence tool designed to rate the promise of scientific papers on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments available when testing is completed. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the tool would be available later this year.\n\nIndeed.\n\n\\---\n\n*Originally published on* [*Substack*](https:\/\/divergentdata.substack.com\/p\/on-not-fighting-covid-with-ai)",

Thus far in the conference, I came across quite a lot of papers with questionable motives which made me question the ethical consequences.\n\nThese papers are, for the most part, concerned with various forms of person identification (i.e., typical big brother stuff). In fact, when you look at the accepted papers, more than 80% of any kind of identification papers have Chinese authors\/affiliations.\n\nBut that's not all, some papers go to extreme lengths of person re-identification such as:\n\n1- Occluded person re- identification (i.e., person re-identification through mask\/glass)\n\n2- Person re-identification in low-light environments\n\n3- Cross domain person re-identification\n\n4- Cross dataset person re-identification\n\n5- Cross modality person re-identification\n\n6- Unsupervised person re-identification\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd maybe you think person re-identification is all there is, but its not. There are also:\n\n1- Vehicle identification, vehicle re-identification, vehicle re-identification from aerial images\n\n2- Occluded vehicle recovery\n\n3- Lip reading from video sequences\n\n4- Crowd counting in scenes, crowd density prediction, and crowd counting in aerial pictures (in fact, all but one crowd counting papers are China affiliated)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder whether I am being overly sensitive due to recent influx of news about Uighurs in China and Hong Kong protests etc. or if these papers are basically funded by the Chinese government (or its extensions) for some big brother stuff.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the research on these subjects which can be used for some ethically questionable applications getting published in top conferences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should mention that I did not mean to offend any Chinese researchers and I am of course aware that many great inventions in recent ML\/DL research that we use came from Chinese researchers. What I stated above is merely my observation while passing by the posters in the conference.\n\nEdit2: If you want to check it out yourself, you can visit [http:\/\/openaccess.thecvf.com\/ICCV2019.py](http:\/\/openaccess.thecvf.com\/ICCV2019.py) and search the term 'identification'.",

Their intention is that players treat AlphaStar as any other player.\n* Replays will be used to publish a peer-reviewer paper.\n* They restricted this version of AlphaStar to only interact with the information it gets from the game camera (I assume that this includes the minimap, and not the API from the January version?).\n* They also increased the restrictions of AlphaStar actions-per-minute (APM), according to pro players advice. There is no additional info in the blog about how this restriction is taking place.\n\nPersonally, I see this as a very interesting experiment, although I'll like to know more details about the new restrictions that AlphaStar will be using, because as it was discussed here in January, such restrictions can be unfair to human players.

        "body":"The deadline for submitting papers to the NeurIPS 2020 conference was two weeks ago. Since then, almost everyday I come across long Twitter threads from ML researchers that publicly advertise their work (obviously NeurIPS submissions, from the template and date of the shared arXiv preprint). They are often quite famous researchers from Google, Facebook... with thousands of followers and therefore a high visibility on Twitter. These posts often get a lot of likes and retweets - see examples in comment.\n\nWhile I am glad to discover new exciting works, I am also concerned by the impact of such practice on the review process. I know that submissions of arXiv preprints are not forbidden by NeurIPS, but this kind of very engaging public advertising brings the anonymity violation to another level.\n\nBesides harming the double-blind review process, I am concerned by the social pressure it puts on reviewers. It is definitely harder to reject or even criticise a work that already received praise across the community through such advertising, especially when it comes from the account of a famous researcher or a famous institution.\n\nHowever, in recent Twitter discussions associated to these threads, I failed to find people caring about these aspects, notably among top researchers reacting to the posts. Would you also say that this is fine (as, anyway, we cannot really assume that a review is double-blind when arXiv public preprints with authors names and affiliations are allowed)? Or do you agree that this can be a problem?",

        "body":"*Aside from the clickbait title, I am earnestly looking for some advice and discussion from people who are actually employed. That being said, here's my gripe:*\n\nI have been relentlessly inundated by the words \"AI, ML, Big Data\" throughout my undergrad from other CS majors, business and sales oriented people, media, and <insert-catchy-name>.ai type startups. It seems like everyone was peddling ML as the go to solution, the big money earner, and the future of the field. I've heard college freshman ask stuff like, \"if I want to do CS, am I going to need to learn ML to be relevant\" - if you're on this sub, I probably do not need to continue to elaborate on just how ridiculous the ML craze is.  Every single university has opened up ML departments or programs and are pumping out ML graduates at an unprecedented rate. **Surely, there'd be a job market to meet the incredible supply of graduates and cultural interest?**\n\nSwept up in a mixture of genuine interest and hype, I decided to pursue computer vision. I majored in Math-CS at a [top-10](http:\/\/csrankings.org\/#\/index?all) CS university (based on at least one arbitrary ranking). I had three computer vision internships, two at startups, one at NASA JPL, in each doing non-trivial CV work; I (re)implemented and integrated CV systems from mixtures of recently published papers. I have a bunch of projects showing both CV and CS fundamentals (OS, networking, data structures, algorithms, etc) knowledge. I have taken graduate level ML coursework. I was accepted to Carnegie Mellon for an MS in Computer Vision, but I deferred to 2021 - all in all, I worked my ass off to try to simultaneously get a solid background in math AND computer science AND computer vision.\n\nThat brings me to where I am now, which is unemployed and looking for jobs. Almost every single position I have seen requires a PhD and\/or 5+ years of experience, and whatever I have applied for has ghosted me so far. The notion that ML is a high paying in-demand field seems to only be true if your name is Andrej Karpathy - and I'm only sort of joking. It seems like unless you have a PhD from one of the big 4 in CS and multiple publications in top tier journals you're out of luck, or at least vying for one of the few remaining positions at small companies.\n\nThis seems normalized in ML, but this is not the case for quite literally every other subfield or even generalized CS positions. Getting a high paying job at a Big N company is possible as a new grad with just a bachelors and general SWE knowledge, and there are a plethora of positions elsewhere. Getting the equivalent with basically every specialization, whether operating systems, distributed systems, security, networking, etc, is also possible, and doesn't require 5 CVPR publications.\n\n**TL;DR** **From my personal perspective,** **if you want to do ML because of career prospects, salaries, or job security, pick almost any other CS specialization**. In ML, you'll find yourself working 2x as hard through difficult theory and math to find yourself competing with more applicants for fewer positions.\n\nI am absolutely complaining and would love to hear a more positive perspective, but in the meanwhile I'll be applying to jobs, working on more post-grad projects, and contemplating switching fields.

        "body":"From their [page](https:\/\/iclr.cc\/Conferences\/2020\/virtual):\n\n# ICLR2020 as a Fully Virtual Conference\n\nDue to growing concerns about COVID-19, ICLR2020 will cancel its physical conference this year, instead shifting to a fully virtual conference. We were very excited to hold ICLR in Addis Ababa, and it is disappointing that we will not all be able to come together in person in April. This unfortunate event does give us the opportunity to innovate on how to host an effective remote conference. The organizing committees are now working to create a virtual conference that will be valuable and engaging for both presenters and attendees. \n\nImmediate guidance for authors, and questions about registration and participation are given below. We are actively discussing several options, with full details to be announced soon. \n\n## Information for Authors of Accepted Papers\n\nAll accepted papers at the virtual conference will be presented using a pre-recorded video. \n\nAll accepted papers (poster, spotlight, long talk) will need to create a 5 minute video that will be used during the virtual poster session.\n\nIn addition, papers accepted as a long-talk should create a 15 minute video.\n\nWe will provide more detailed instructions soon, particularly on how to record your presentations. In the interim, please do begin preparing your talk and associated slides. \n\nEach video should use a set of slides, and should be timed carefully to not exceed the time allocation. The slides should be in widescreen format (16:9), and can be created in any presentation software that allows you to export to PDF (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, Beamer, etc). \n\n## Virtual Conference Dates\n\nThe conference will still take place between April 25 and April 30, as these are the dates people have allocated to attend the conference. We expect most participants will still commit their time during this window to participate in the conference, and have discussions with fellow researchers around the world. \n\n## Conference Registration Fee\n\nThe registration fee will be substantially reduced to 50 USD for students and 100 USD for non-students. For those who have already registered, we will automatically refund the remainder of the registration fee, so that you only pay this new reduced rate. Registration provides each participant with an access code to participate in sessions where they can ask questions of speakers, see questions and answers from other participants, take part in discussion groups, meet with sponsors, and join groups for networking. Registration furthermore supports the infrastructure needed to host and support the virtual conference. \n\n## Registration Support \n\nThere will be funding available for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to get registration reimbursed, with similar conditions to the Travel Support Application. If you have already applied for and received a travel grant for ICLR 2020, you will get free registration for ICLR 2020. The Travel Application on the website will be updated soon, to accept applications for free registration, with the deadline extended to April 10, 2020. \n\n## Workshops\n\nWe will send details for workshops through the workshop organisers soon, but it is expected that these will follow a similar virtual format to the main conference.\n\nhttps:\/\/iclr.cc\/Conferences\/2020\/virtual",

I thought to myself that surely it must be a big deal to be in the Wikipedia article of SGD alongside RMSProp and Adam, but it turned out to be a paper for 2015 with 21 citations (not that citations are the measure of good science, but the maximally optimistic light would still be that it would be too early to include that along the canonical optimization algorithms of the field).\n\nThis seemed fishy to me so I did some digging. It was added to the Wikipedia article on Febuary 2017 [3], which at the time, the paper appears to have had 0 citations[4], by user Vp314 [5] on Wikipedia, which also happened to be the author's gmail username [6]. Furthermore the only edits that user has done on Wikipedia are related to adding their technique to the Wikipedia page on SGD [5]: one to add the original section[7], one to make a minor correction, and one to re-add that section[8] (in April 2018) after it was deleted with the comment \"Removed a recent extension which has been hardly cited by anyone in the academic community. Its appearance in Wikipedia made it look like an established technique, which is not\" [9].\n\nMy instincts are what this person has done is wrong and taking advantage of Wikipedia, but I would love to hear some other perspectives (and maybe get a little less angry).

Disclaimer: I have been working on research projects with Teano, JAX, PT, TF 1 &2, and of course the original Keras.\n\nThe **original Keras** was just a high-level API specification for machine learning, which was really nice when collaborating with people who have less engineering background. The API was framework agnostic and the main implementation supported multiple backends (Teano, Tensorflow, and MS-CNTK)\n\nEssentially, the API design resembled the abstractions of modern high-level frameworks such as PyTorch-Lightning and fast.ai, with slightly different *design* *flavors* (e.g., a Keras model combines the network with the metrics and training code in a single object, whereas other frameworks usually separate the network from the learner object).\n\nThe huge advantage of keras was that it was available and the API stable **back in 2016, 2017.** I think this is something remarkable in a field that moves so fast.\n\nBut then, you know the story, Google announced its plans to incorporated it into Tensorflow 2. This wouldn't have been a problem on its own, but it slowly killed keras for 3 reasons:\n\n1. During the time-span of this merge, the keras API was effectively \"frozen\", making it lag behind alternatives in terms of features\n2. The release of TF2 came too late. On top of that, the first versions were buggy and even now are lacking some basic features.\n3. Instead of making a hard cut between TF 1 and 2, Google decided that it's better to carried over a lot of baggage and crap from TF1, making the framework extremely bloated. When something does not work, you get overwhelmed by long cryptic error messages and stacktraces longer than your screen can visualize.\n\nSo, this post is really intended as a **funeral for the keras API**.\n\nLooking forward to know your thoughts.\n\nEDIT: I have nothing personal against Google. Far from it, I really like their impressive contributions to ML (Colab, TPU, JAX, ...), but the story with keras and TF2 is really frustrating for me who liked working with it in the past.",

        "body":"I was rewatching Return of the Jedi for May the 4th and I realized that I viewed it completely differently then I did before the prequels\/the Disney shows. \n\nWhen watching it as a kid, you get some insight into Vaders history, but only significantly after the father reveal and Luke and Vaders interactions in Return. To someone who\u2019s only ever seen the OT, he\u2019s just a cyborg monster whose past is lightly hinted at until his humanity is redeemed in his final moments. What I love about the prequels and shows is that they put a face to Anakin\/Vader and imo it makes Vaders inner turmoil and redemption far more apparent\/impactful in ROTJ. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to think that Vader was once a plucky kid who dreamed of being a hero and saving everyone he loved. As a young man who was overwhelmingly in love with a woman who convinced him life could be amazing beyond his wildest dreams the second he first saw her. As a prospective father, desperate beyond all measure to save the mother of his children at any cost. And finally, as a vengeful, hate filled atrocity that bathes in his own pain (Obi-Wan show), yet beyond all, is suffering. Being able to put Hayden\u2019s face behind the mask directly impacts how I viewed Vader in return. \n\nBy ROTJ, Vader has revealed his intentions to Luke, but is conflicted about turning his son to the dark side. He knows how it feels, and as broken as he is, there is a part of him (Anakin) that doesn\u2019t want to subject Luke to it. He also knows how powerful it is, and it\u2019s grip on him. When they meet, Luke attempts to sway him, and I now can feel the sorrow when he says \u201cObi-Wan once thought as you do\u201d as he\u2019s likely referring to their penultimate duel. He sounds genuinely pained when telling Luke it\u2019s too late for him. When Luke echoes what Obi-Wan said afterwards \u201cthen my father\/friend is truly dead\u201d, you can feel how it hits Vader as he looks over the railing, wrestling with whether or not Anakin is truly dead: is his former self so consumed by self hatred and pain that he would willingly sacrifice his son to his abuser? \n\nOnce they are on the Death Star, the Emperor attempts to goad Luke\u2019s anger. At first it doesn\u2019t work, but Vader knows whats coming, and tries to soften the blow by telling Luke that resistance is pointless. As the emperor reveals more and more of the trap set for the rebellion, you can see Vader intensely staring at Luke, feeling his sons anger grow. Right before Luke attempts to kill the emperor, you can feel Vader almost pleading with Luke not to do it. Which leads me to my main takeaway from this wall of text: Vader blocks Luke\u2019s saber in this instance not just to save the emperor as planned, but to save Luke as well. I believe that that block was Anakin reaching out to prevent his son from making the same mistake he did. \n\nAt the start of his and Luke\u2019s final duel, some of Anakin is still there, even though Vader slowly creeps back throughout. After he kicks Vader down the stairs, Anakin takes a moment to genuinely compliment Luke\u2019s skill as a Jedi, stating that Obi-Wan taught him well. Anakin and Vader both loved to duel, so both of them getting pissed at Luke for leaving himself defenceless tracks.\n\nVader is back in control now, and in a final act of hateful depravity, vows to turn Leia, his own daughter to the dark side, using more or less the exact same tactic on Luke that Palpatine used to turn him: ensure that someone you love will suffer if you don\u2019t turn. He immediately is set upon by an enraged Luke and is given a mirror to his own rage when he turned. Vader goes on the defensive and is terrified by what his actions have just done. He parries Luke\u2019s frantic blows, and by the time he\u2019s beaten down, he\u2019s done. He doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore, and when he has his remaining hand up to defend from Luke\u2019s saber, it\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s begging Luke not for his life, but for Luke\u2019s. He knows he\u2019s just threatened someone Luke loves, and remembers exactly what that fear did to him.\n\nAnd then, something extraordinary happens. Luke sees his path before him if he gives in, not in a vision, by in his broken and pained husk of a father. Luke refuses his anger, doing what Anakin could not. I believe Vader has let go of his hate at this point. This is a true Jedi Knight, his son, fighting for a man who barely even knows himself anymore. For what is good, even after what the emperor has done. \n\nWhen Palpatine begins electrocuting Luke, all I could see on Vaders face was Anakin paralyzed by fear. The same way he was paralyzed by it when Mace Windu confronted Palpatine. He wrestles with what to do, and finally let\u2019s go of his fear, and decides he will not let it happen again, especially not to his own son. He knows it will kill him, but his compassion has been reignited by his sons, and he no longer cares what happens to him. He is a Jedi once more. He finally gets to see his son: all grown up, a warrior of the light, someone who loves him despite what he\u2019s done. He is complete, and let\u2019s go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not leave you I\u2019ve got to save you\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already have, Luke\u201d. \n\nLuke\u2019s kindness and bravery saved what was left of Anakin, and as a final redemption, Anakin gives his life to save someone he loves, fulfilling his childhood dream of being a true Jedi hero, and going to meet his old friends in peace. The Return of the Jedi refers to Anakin.\n\nGod I love Star Wars.",

Should I watch now the sequel movies and the rest of the solo movies and shows after, or skip the sequels to last?

        "body":" 9. Rise of Skywalker. Miserable in concept, theory, and execution. The worst by a wide margin. Say what you will about TLJ, undoing everything *again* was a terrible choice. A trainwreck of a film.\n\n8. Phantom Menace - History has been kind to the prequels, but this was just a bad movie. Baffling choice to spend an entire film with 5 year old Anakin. Avoids the basement because the prequels do have charm that the sequels lacked.\n\n7. The Last Jedi - Giving a genre film to an outsider can yield interesting results (many MCU films), but here Rian Johnson wore his disdain on his sleeve and you could tell. Annoying plot holes, confusing lore decisions, and ill-advised reversal of the groundwork set in TFA were supposed to be fresh, but didn't quite work. Still, some of the best set pieces in the entire series, and technically good filmmaking keep this at the top of the bottom tier.\n\n6. Attack of the Clones - Bland, lifeless film. Didn't do much wrong but didn't do much right either. Enjoyable, forgettable, but I ultimately left the theater unsatisfied.\n\n5. The Force Awakens - Bland, lifeless film. Didn't do much wrong, but didn't do much right either. Enjoyable, forgettable, but I *did* leave the theater satisfied. Star Wars was back, and it wasn't terrible.\n\n4. Return of the Jedi - Widely considered the worst of the original trilogy. I agree, but only because the other two were so fantastic, not because this movie was bad. Yes, Ewoks are kind of lame, but an altogether solid film, and markedly better than almost everything that has come out since. Importantly, it was a satisfying resolution to Anakin's story.\n\n3. Revenge of the Sith - Yes, history has been kind to the prequels, but even at the time this was recognized as a great entry. Leagues better than the other prequels, this was the part of the story we'd all been waiting to see, and by and large it was handled deftly. Anakin's fall was satisfying, as was the conversion of the Republic to the Empire. Some stupid dialogue aside, this was flat great.\n\n2. Empire Strikes Back - Controversial to put this second, but it always felt a little disjoined to me. More a collection of vignettes than a cohesive film. Still, the vignettes are all absolute classics. Does exactly what a sequel should in terms of expanding the scope of the original. You can't argue with Empire.\n\n1. A New Hope - The original and still the best",

Personally I really enjoy his character and hope to know what happened to him.",

I would love to see some added depth to his character other than just him being the embodiment of evil. If I were to write his story I would probably use the Count of Monte Cristo as inspiration it is one of my favorite literary works and if think it fits the theme of star wars\/ Sheevs character. Sheev would fit the role of Edmond Dantes and Sidious would be the Count role. Plagueis would be the crazy abby in the prison who is Edmonds mentor in chose that role because Plagueis could play someone who is more than he appears.

Anyway, I'm halfway through Andor, which is fantastic, but it's frustrating. Frustrating in the sense that it's such a clear, idiosyncratic vision of a down n' dirty story of the regular citizens living among the rebellion and imperial colonialization. It's political, it's thoughtful, it's incredibly well-written, and most importantly, there are no Jedi. \n\nI say no Jedi in a positive light, as I always found the smaller stories far more interesting, and when sparsely used, the Jedi or Sith encounters would be TREMENDOUSLY effective. There would be a sense of wonder and danger around these figures, but right now, every show has multiple Jedi or Sith, and it's kind of... deflating, I guess? \n\nAm I the only one thinking the franchise could do with less whizz-bang Jedi action and more contemplative series\/movies? I know it's a monstrously popular IP, so Disney aren't likely to make a drama set in the universe, but it would be nice to see more scaled back series like Andor.",

Its a shame that Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford did not get to share a scene again. I wonder if they could have had a flashback scene of Kylo where he remembers a scene from his childhood and it shows the big three back together again. Perhaps when Han and Leia dropped young Ben at Lukes training academy when he was younger? They also should have had all the old main characters back together again (Luke, Han, Leia, Chewy, C3P0, and R2) like seriously JJ that should have been your main priority!",

Also amazing. First one to make me cry. 9\/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the Stars - Art style was indifferent. Story was fantastic. 8\/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am Your Mother - Decent art style, light hearted fun. 7\/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJourney to the Dark Head - Fantastic story.
