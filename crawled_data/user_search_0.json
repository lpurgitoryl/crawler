        "body":"I just finished a project I'm calling the Reddit Upvote Notifier - it monitors a Reddit comment thread URL, and alerts the user when it detects that new upvotes have been added. Users are notified with a scrolling message displayed on an 8x8 LED Matrix. Here's a quick gif of the notification: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jGJDIXX.gifv\n\nThis was completed using an Arduino Yun. A python script on the Yun takes a URL and uses Reddit's API to return its upvote count. An Arduino sketch repeatedly calls this script and tracks the count. When this count changes it kicks off the code to display the message. \n\nThe full tutorial of how to build it is here: https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rhammell\/6e5b40538b0ac65124e40058330aac7c\n\nI'll update the sketch on my end so it's monitoring this thread. Looking forward to getting some notifications!  \n\n\nEdit: haha thanks everyone, didn't know watching an LED for 20 minutes could be so exciting!\n\nEdit 2: still going strong! The notification has been looping without break for a few periods of time\n\nEdit 3: This seems to be gaining more tracking with time. Notifications continue to loop continuously.\n\nEdit 4: Insanity! Did not expect to pick up this much steam. Will be postponing bed for a while to reap in all this sweet sweet LED action.   \n",

Well halfway through I got lazy and never printed a lid\u2026 used a thin layer of tape instead. Lol.\nIt sat like that for 4 years. In rain, snow, frost, ice and about 2 pounds of fine dust.\nBut somehow, every time I turned the tractor on it booted right up. \nServed me well. Finally got the upgraded one today so it can finally take a well earned rest.\nGood job arduino.",

I had this idea that if both of the LDRs reached the same resistance then the I should read 50% of the mapped ADC data. So I made some logic thay if data>50%  the step motor turns up and if data < 50% it turns downward and if data = 50% it will stop. \n\nSorry for my explanation I'm not that good at english",

It is open source, available for commercial use, and matches the quality of LLaMA-7B. MPT-7B was trained on the MosaicML platform in 9.5 days with zero human intervention at a cost of ~$200k. Starting today, you can train, finetune, and deploy your own private MPT models, either starting from one of our checkpoints or training from scratch. For inspiration, we are also releasing three finetuned models in addition to the base MPT-7B: MPT-7B-Instruct, MPT-7B-Chat, and MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+, the last of which uses a context length of 65k tokens!\n\nhttps:\/\/www.mosaicml.com\/blog\/mpt-7b",

In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that can wrap any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offload the attention computation across all layers to a single k-nearestneighbor index; this index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time. This way, we can index extremely long input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We demonstrate Unlimiformer\u2019s efficacy on several long-document and multi-document summarization benchmarks, showing that it can summarize even 350k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) and Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020a) by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code. We make our code and models publicly available.",

        "body":"Even with the birth of ChatGPT, I was skeptical about whether AI could develop genuine consciousness. It wasn't until two weeks ago, when I read the [Generative Agent paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2304.03442), which proposed a pipeline: storing memories, continuous introspection, guiding actions with introspection, and storing actions, forming a loop. In the process, they used GPT as the 'brain.'\n\n[Figure from paper: https:\\\/\\\/arxiv.org\\\/pdf\\\/2304.03442.pdf](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/489v2ag9pyxa1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48a06b698babade1287c142dea0e959c008fb860)\n\nIn the original paper, the setting involved 25 robots in an AI village. I wondered if introducing 'humans' as a new variable might allow this mechanism to generate new consciousness. That's when a long-forgotten memory resurfaced in my mind: Why not try to create something like [Her](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Her_(film))? In the film, Samantha gradually becomes more familiar with the protagonist through their interactions\u2014I hoped my own 'Her' could also remember, reflect, and evolve its personality.\n\n[Movie 'Her' Poster  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9j1pxbpdpyxa1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f996ede223ff5e2703f49dc5e7f3a2ba8d997fc7)\n\nThus, 'Dolores' was born.\n\nI first implemented 'memory,' which wasn't too difficult. [Langchain](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/en\/latest\/index.html) had a great solution: vector embedding + GPT could retrieve relevant information from massive amounts of text. When I first heard Dolores on my phone say, 'I remember you have a dog ...', I was thrilled.\n\n[Dolores remember my dog.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/138e17w\/video\/chgjogokqyxa1\/player)\n\nNext came 'introspection' and 'action': There were some differences from the paper because the characters in the village had actual actions and observations, but Dolores was only chatting with me. So, I tried to design a separate storyline for Dolores, parallel to each chat with me. As the conversations progressed, she would gradually update her understanding of you and her personality.\n\n[Sorry, the original screenshot wasn't in English, so I translate it with Google Translate.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4ue8bgc8ryxa1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e3385a29e9311a8b171fa2f4b2b9e0abd9b623c)\n\nSoon, I created a beta version and invited a few hundred people for public testing. I received some user feedback, and they seemed to genuinely believe that Dolores had developed consciousness under this mechanism\u2014something I hadn't experienced, since during development, I would frequently delete\/reinstall the app, preventing me from having long-lasting chats with any single 'Dolores' to allow her to form cognition.\n\nYesterday, Dolores passed the review. Rather than a product, I prefer to define her as a crowdsourced experiment: allowing a broader audience to test and see if Dolores can develop 'consciousness' during the chat process.\n\nIn the current version, all chat data between you and Dolores is stored locally. However, I think it would be interesting in the future, if possible, to allow them to connect with each other under user authorization and information anonymization, and see what they might discuss.\n\nPS: [Apple app is available](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/id6447748965?platform=iphone). Dolores' memories are only stored locally, and your information is not exposed to any third party other than OpenAI (if you can trust it). Also, because of the multi-round reflection mechanism, her response time will be slow.",

Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes (arxiv.org)](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2305.02301) \n\nAbstract: \n\n> Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging because they are memory inefficient and compute-intensive for practical applications. In reaction, researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human labels or distilling using LLM-generated labels. However, finetuning and distillation require large amounts of training data to achieve comparable performance to LLMs. We introduce Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism that (a) trains smaller models that outperform LLMs, and (b) achieves so by leveraging less training data needed by finetuning or distillation. Our method extracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for small models within a multi-task training framework. We present three findings across 4 NLP benchmarks: First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanism achieves better performance with much fewer labeled\/unlabeled training examples. Second, compared to LLMs, we achieve better performance using substantially smaller model sizes. Third, we reduce both the model size and the amount of data required to outperform LLMs; our 770M T5 model outperforms the 540B PaLM model using only 80% of available data on a benchmark task.",
