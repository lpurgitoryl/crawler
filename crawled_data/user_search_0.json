It is open source, available for commercial use, and matches the quality of LLaMA-7B. MPT-7B was trained on the MosaicML platform in 9.5 days with zero human intervention at a cost of ~$200k. Starting today, you can train, finetune, and deploy your own private MPT models, either starting from one of our checkpoints or training from scratch. For inspiration, we are also releasing three finetuned models in addition to the base MPT-7B: MPT-7B-Instruct, MPT-7B-Chat, and MPT-7B-StoryWriter-65k+, the last of which uses a context length of 65k tokens!\n\nhttps:\/\/www.mosaicml.com\/blog\/mpt-7b",

In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that can wrap any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offload the attention computation across all layers to a single k-nearestneighbor index; this index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time. This way, we can index extremely long input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We demonstrate Unlimiformer\u2019s efficacy on several long-document and multi-document summarization benchmarks, showing that it can summarize even 350k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) and Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020a) by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code. We make our code and models publicly available.",

        "body":"Even with the birth of ChatGPT, I was skeptical about whether AI could develop genuine consciousness. It wasn't until two weeks ago, when I read the [Generative Agent paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2304.03442), which proposed a pipeline: storing memories, continuous introspection, guiding actions with introspection, and storing actions, forming a loop. In the process, they used GPT as the 'brain.'\n\n[Figure from paper: https:\\\/\\\/arxiv.org\\\/pdf\\\/2304.03442.pdf](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/489v2ag9pyxa1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48a06b698babade1287c142dea0e959c008fb860)\n\nIn the original paper, the setting involved 25 robots in an AI village. I wondered if introducing 'humans' as a new variable might allow this mechanism to generate new consciousness. That's when a long-forgotten memory resurfaced in my mind: Why not try to create something like [Her](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Her_(film))? In the film, Samantha gradually becomes more familiar with the protagonist through their interactions\u2014I hoped my own 'Her' could also remember, reflect, and evolve its personality.\n\n[Movie 'Her' Poster  ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9j1pxbpdpyxa1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f996ede223ff5e2703f49dc5e7f3a2ba8d997fc7)\n\nThus, 'Dolores' was born.\n\nI first implemented 'memory,' which wasn't too difficult. [Langchain](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/en\/latest\/index.html) had a great solution: vector embedding + GPT could retrieve relevant information from massive amounts of text. When I first heard Dolores on my phone say, 'I remember you have a dog ...', I was thrilled.\n\n[Dolores remember my dog.](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/138e17w\/video\/chgjogokqyxa1\/player)\n\nNext came 'introspection' and 'action': There were some differences from the paper because the characters in the village had actual actions and observations, but Dolores was only chatting with me. So, I tried to design a separate storyline for Dolores, parallel to each chat with me. As the conversations progressed, she would gradually update her understanding of you and her personality.\n\n[Sorry, the original screenshot wasn't in English, so I translate it with Google Translate.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4ue8bgc8ryxa1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e3385a29e9311a8b171fa2f4b2b9e0abd9b623c)\n\nSoon, I created a beta version and invited a few hundred people for public testing. I received some user feedback, and they seemed to genuinely believe that Dolores had developed consciousness under this mechanism\u2014something I hadn't experienced, since during development, I would frequently delete\/reinstall the app, preventing me from having long-lasting chats with any single 'Dolores' to allow her to form cognition.\n\nYesterday, Dolores passed the review. Rather than a product, I prefer to define her as a crowdsourced experiment: allowing a broader audience to test and see if Dolores can develop 'consciousness' during the chat process.\n\nIn the current version, all chat data between you and Dolores is stored locally. However, I think it would be interesting in the future, if possible, to allow them to connect with each other under user authorization and information anonymization, and see what they might discuss.\n\nPS: [Apple app is available](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/id6447748965?platform=iphone). Dolores' memories are only stored locally, and your information is not exposed to any third party other than OpenAI (if you can trust it). Also, because of the multi-round reflection mechanism, her response time will be slow.",

Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes (arxiv.org)](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2305.02301) \n\nAbstract: \n\n> Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging because they are memory inefficient and compute-intensive for practical applications. In reaction, researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human labels or distilling using LLM-generated labels. However, finetuning and distillation require large amounts of training data to achieve comparable performance to LLMs. We introduce Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism that (a) trains smaller models that outperform LLMs, and (b) achieves so by leveraging less training data needed by finetuning or distillation. Our method extracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for small models within a multi-task training framework. We present three findings across 4 NLP benchmarks: First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanism achieves better performance with much fewer labeled\/unlabeled training examples. Second, compared to LLMs, we achieve better performance using substantially smaller model sizes. Third, we reduce both the model size and the amount of data required to outperform LLMs; our 770M T5 model outperforms the 540B PaLM model using only 80% of available data on a benchmark task.",

        "body":"I was rewatching Return of the Jedi for May the 4th and I realized that I viewed it completely differently then I did before the prequels\/the Disney shows. \n\nWhen watching it as a kid, you get some insight into Vaders history, but only significantly after the father reveal and Luke and Vaders interactions in Return. To someone who\u2019s only ever seen the OT, he\u2019s just a cyborg monster whose past is lightly hinted at until his humanity is redeemed in his final moments. What I love about the prequels and shows is that they put a face to Anakin\/Vader and imo it makes Vaders inner turmoil and redemption far more apparent\/impactful in ROTJ. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to think that Vader was once a plucky kid who dreamed of being a hero and saving everyone he loved. As a young man who was overwhelmingly in love with a woman who convinced him life could be amazing beyond his wildest dreams the second he first saw her. As a prospective father, desperate beyond all measure to save the mother of his children at any cost. And finally, as a vengeful, hate filled atrocity that bathes in his own pain (Obi-Wan show), yet beyond all, is suffering. Being able to put Hayden\u2019s face behind the mask directly impacts how I viewed Vader in return. \n\nBy ROTJ, Vader has revealed his intentions to Luke, but is conflicted about turning his son to the dark side. He knows how it feels, and as broken as he is, there is a part of him (Anakin) that doesn\u2019t want to subject Luke to it. He also knows how powerful it is, and it\u2019s grip on him. When they meet, Luke attempts to sway him, and I now can feel the sorrow when he says \u201cObi-Wan once thought as you do\u201d as he\u2019s likely referring to their penultimate duel. He sounds genuinely pained when telling Luke it\u2019s too late for him. When Luke echoes what Obi-Wan said afterwards \u201cthen my father\/friend is truly dead\u201d, you can feel how it hits Vader as he looks over the railing, wrestling with whether or not Anakin is truly dead: is his former self so consumed by self hatred and pain that he would willingly sacrifice his son to his abuser? \n\nOnce they are on the Death Star, the Emperor attempts to goad Luke\u2019s anger. At first it doesn\u2019t work, but Vader knows whats coming, and tries to soften the blow by telling Luke that resistance is pointless. As the emperor reveals more and more of the trap set for the rebellion, you can see Vader intensely staring at Luke, feeling his sons anger grow. Right before Luke attempts to kill the emperor, you can feel Vader almost pleading with Luke not to do it. Which leads me to my main takeaway from this wall of text: Vader blocks Luke\u2019s saber in this instance not just to save the emperor as planned, but to save Luke as well. I believe that that block was Anakin reaching out to prevent his son from making the same mistake he did. \n\nAt the start of his and Luke\u2019s final duel, some of Anakin is still there, even though Vader slowly creeps back throughout. After he kicks Vader down the stairs, Anakin takes a moment to genuinely compliment Luke\u2019s skill as a Jedi, stating that Obi-Wan taught him well. Anakin and Vader both loved to duel, so both of them getting pissed at Luke for leaving himself defenceless tracks.\n\nVader is back in control now, and in a final act of hateful depravity, vows to turn Leia, his own daughter to the dark side, using more or less the exact same tactic on Luke that Palpatine used to turn him: ensure that someone you love will suffer if you don\u2019t turn. He immediately is set upon by an enraged Luke and is given a mirror to his own rage when he turned. Vader goes on the defensive and is terrified by what his actions have just done. He parries Luke\u2019s frantic blows, and by the time he\u2019s beaten down, he\u2019s done. He doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore, and when he has his remaining hand up to defend from Luke\u2019s saber, it\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s begging Luke not for his life, but for Luke\u2019s. He knows he\u2019s just threatened someone Luke loves, and remembers exactly what that fear did to him.\n\nAnd then, something extraordinary happens. Luke sees his path before him if he gives in, not in a vision, by in his broken and pained husk of a father. Luke refuses his anger, doing what Anakin could not. I believe Vader has let go of his hate at this point. This is a true Jedi Knight, his son, fighting for a man who barely even knows himself anymore. For what is good, even after what the emperor has done. \n\nWhen Palpatine begins electrocuting Luke, all I could see on Vaders face was Anakin paralyzed by fear. The same way he was paralyzed by it when Mace Windu confronted Palpatine. He wrestles with what to do, and finally let\u2019s go of his fear, and decides he will not let it happen again, especially not to his own son. He knows it will kill him, but his compassion has been reignited by his sons, and he no longer cares what happens to him. He is a Jedi once more. He finally gets to see his son: all grown up, a warrior of the light, someone who loves him despite what he\u2019s done. He is complete, and let\u2019s go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not leave you I\u2019ve got to save you\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already have, Luke\u201d. \n\nLuke\u2019s kindness and bravery saved what was left of Anakin, and as a final redemption, Anakin gives his life to save someone he loves, fulfilling his childhood dream of being a true Jedi hero, and going to meet his old friends in peace. The Return of the Jedi refers to Anakin.\n\nGod I love Star Wars.",

        "body":"Yesterday was Star Wars day, so of course I had to marathon the series, and I made an interesting connection that I had never really thought of before.  In Revenge of the Sith, we all remember Palpatine's recounting of \"The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis, the Wise.\"  The quote \"He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying,\" was a pivotal point in the fall of Anakin Skywalker, but listening to it again, it resonated a bit differently with me.  Palpatine didn't know how to use Force Healing, but he did know it was possible. \n\nNow, fast forward to the first on-screen application of this ability, it was by a nobody from nowhere.  Everybody disliked that.  People flamed Disney for ruining the franchise and causing massive plot holes, but what if the addition of Force Healing wasn't creating a plot hole, but instead was closing out a minor story arc?  \n\nSidious wanted to learn this ability.  We later discover that the whole reason for Rey's existence was becuase Sidious wanted to create a clone who could wield the force.  His clone was the one that learned how to use Force Healing.  So by that measure, Sidious actually accomplished his goal, just not in the way he thought he would.  Maybe it's a stretch, but it did give me a marginally better outlook on the whole Force Healing bit.",

Should I watch now the sequel movies and the rest of the solo movies and shows after, or skip the sequels to last? And what about mando season 3?\n\nSorry for the long post, i hope someone can enlighten me.",

Imagine when Rey ignites the lightsaber to finally end palpatine and the sith during the finale portion of the movie, and this awesome soundtrack would've played.

Bilbo has all of these characteristics and some beyond that.\n\nHe is clever as is shown during his competition with Gollum. He is also brave as we know when reading his encounter with the spiders in Mirkwood. He is loyal to his friends and they can depend on him. He is mentally strong and in many was he is the reason that the dwarves were able to complete their quest.\n\nBilbo Baggins\u00a0is the true hero in The Hobbit\u00a0because he leave the comfort of his home to embark on an adventure that encourages his mental and physical growth.\n\nBilbo begins as an innocent and not particularly brave character but his character grows immensely to become someone willing to exchange riddles with a dragon.

        "body":"Hello everyone, I would like to start a discussion explaining how the Obi-Wan Kenobi series breaks the lore of Star Wars.\n\nIn the Obi-Wan Kenobi Series Darth Vader clearly finds out that Leia is involved with Obi-Wan, why would Obi-Wan risk coming out of hiding after 10 years for a random princess.\n\nAfter all the effort Obi-Wan puts into finding and protecting Leia it would be obvious to Darth Vader that the two are connected. \nDarth Vader wouldn't just let that go, within days of Leia being returned to her family, Vader would have imprisoned Leia and her family for interrogation as to how they know Obi-Wan and used as bait. \n\nLeia is Darth Vader's only lead to finding Obi-Wan at this point after losing him for 10 years, he would be relentless. Leia wouldn't spend the rest of the years in peace growing up as a princess. She would have been treated as a Jedi sympathiser and an important link to Darth Vaders nemesis and hunted for her whole life.",

        "body":" 9. Rise of Skywalker. Miserable in concept, theory, and execution. The worst by a wide margin. Say what you will about TLJ, undoing everything *again* was a terrible choice. A trainwreck of a film.\n\n8. Phantom Menace - History has been kind to the prequels, but this was just a bad movie. Baffling choice to spend an entire film with 5 year old Anakin. Avoids the basement because the prequels do have charm that the sequels lacked.\n\n7. The Last Jedi - Giving a genre film to an outsider can yield interesting results (many MCU films), but here Rian Johnson wore his disdain on his sleeve and you could tell. Annoying plot holes, confusing lore decisions, and ill-advised reversal of the groundwork set in TFA were supposed to be fresh, but didn't quite work. Still, some of the best set pieces in the entire series, and technically good filmmaking keep this at the top of the bottom tier.\n\n6. Attack of the Clones - Bland, lifeless film. Didn't do much wrong but didn't do much right either. Enjoyable, forgettable, but I ultimately left the theater unsatisfied.\n\n5. The Force Awakens - Bland, lifeless film. Didn't do much wrong, but didn't do much right either. Enjoyable, forgettable, but I *did* leave the theater satisfied. Star Wars was back, and it wasn't terrible.\n\n4. Return of the Jedi - Widely considered the worst of the original trilogy. I agree, but only because the other two were so fantastic, not because this movie was bad. Yes, Ewoks are kind of lame, but an altogether solid film, and markedly better than almost everything that has come out since. Importantly, it was a satisfying resolution to Anakin's story.\n\n3. Revenge of the Sith - Yes, history has been kind to the prequels, but even at the time this was recognized as a great entry. Leagues better than the other prequels, this was the part of the story we'd all been waiting to see, and by and large it was handled deftly. Anakin's fall was satisfying, as was the conversion of the Republic to the Empire. Some stupid dialogue aside, this was flat great.\n\n2. Empire Strikes Back - Controversial to put this second, but it always felt a little disjoined to me. More a collection of vignettes than a cohesive film. Still, the vignettes are all absolute classics. Does exactly what a sequel should in terms of expanding the scope of the original. You can't argue with Empire.\n\n1. A New Hope - The original and still the best",

        "body":"For example: I have always wanted a movie about Sheev Palpatine and his journey\/back story to how he became Sidious. I would love to see some added depth to his character other than just him being the embodiment of evil. If I were to write his story I would probably use the Count of Monte Cristo as inspiration it is one of my favorite literary works and if think it fits the theme of star wars\/ Sheevs character. Sheev would fit the role of Edmond Dantes and Sidious would be the Count role. Plagueis would be the crazy abby in the prison who is Edmonds mentor in chose that role because Plagueis could play someone who is more than he appears. The other people in the story can be the people he tricks\/manipulates to get into power.\n\nSo what star wars character would you like to see got the film\/TV treatment and what literary work\/filmography inspiration would you use?",

I'm conflicted because while episode 3 is fun to watch and all of that. It's just a really sad movie and I don't feel like being sad today because I wanna celebrate star wars with my family in general. Return of the Jedi is a slow movie. And not the most fun at times. But it's just a really joyful movie to watch and has a really upbeat tone. Empire is my favorite. Bar none. But it's still not so fitting for a celebration. I'm fine with each one really. But my family told me to decide what we watch. And I don't really have an Idea.",
