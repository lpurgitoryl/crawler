You can see as soon as I plug in the OBD USB the pressure values bug out. \n\nBasically I am using an UNO to read temp and pressure data for our race truck. I also need to use the OBD data logger to monitor data. The arduino is passing serial data to the computer and then I wrote a python script to present and record in this GUI. I have tried all the different ports as well as getting a powered USB hub to plug one of the cables into, nothing seems to work. Any help is appreciated. \n\nTopped off with attempting to plug the ISB in the wrong way. ",

Everything I send to the screens appears perfectly on both screens. This was a surprising result because I had always learned that 2 devices cannot use the same i2c address without causing collisions.\n\nTo me, there seems to be only 2 possible explanations, and I'm curious which one is correct, or if there's another solution I'm not seeing. Either (1) the screens do not send any information back to the Arduino, they only receive data, or (2), they do send some data back, but they coincidentally are always sending it in perfect unison so they never notice a collision with each other.\n\nI find the second explanation to be less believable, but I'm curious to know why this setup works so perfectly. Could this be reliably expanded? If I for some reason wanted to build something that had 5 or more screens that all displayed the same information, could I just keep adding on more screens that share the same i2c address?",
