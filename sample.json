        "body": "# r/arduino Monthly digest for 2023-03\n\n\n## Helping us to help you\n\nOver the past several weeks, we have been busy updating our [wiki](/r/arduino/wiki/index/).\n\nA specific area of focus has been to provide additional information about [how to post](/r/arduino/wiki/guides/how_to_post_quick_notes/).\nAdditionally there is a specific page about [how to post code and other text such as error messages](/r/arduino/wiki/guides/how_to_post_formatted_code/)\n\nWhy is this important? Because if you are seeking help you will be more likely to quickly get the help you are seeking if you include the important details\nin a form that makes it easier for people to help you.\n\nAs a reminder, photos, screenshots and videos of code are against the rules and usually make it much more difficult for people to help you.\n\n## 550K subscribers\n\nOn the 14th of December we reached 500,000 subscribers. Just 3 months later we reached 550,000 subscribers on about the 10th of March.\nIt's great to see so many new subscribers, some posting, some commenting, some lurking but all contributing in their own way.\n\n## Moderator team expansion\n\nAlso this month we have increased the moderator team by three.\n\nSo, a big welcome to u/pacmanic, u/the_3d6 and u/toebeanteddybears as our newest moderators.\nInitially they will help out with a few background tasks that will become more apparent over the upcoming weeks and months.\n\n\n## What can I make with this \"stuff\"?\n\nA commonly asked question is the \"what can I make with this stuff?\".\nSometimes, these questions receive cynical and unhelpful replies, which while understandable are not within the rules.\n\nAs a result, we thought it would be interesting to [ask ChatGPT](/r/arduino/wiki/guides/what_to_buy_guide/what_can_i_make_with_this_stuff/#wiki_what_can_i_do_with_this_.22stuff.22.3F).\nAs it turned out, ChatGPT gave a [pretty good reply](/r/arduino/wiki/guides/what_to_buy_guide/what_can_i_make_with_this_stuff/#wiki_the_chatgpt_reply). So, if you see a\n\"What can I make ...\" style question - which is a fair question - but are frustrated by the frequency of it being asked, perhaps refer\nthe OP to [our ChatGPT session transcript](/r/arduino/wiki/guides/what_to_buy_guide/what_can_i_make_with_this_stuff/#wiki_what_can_i_do_with_this_.22stuff.22.3F)\nand suggest that they ask ChatGPT using that transcript as a template.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to check out our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/index/)\nfor up to date guides, FAQ, milestones, glossary and more.\n\nYou can find our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/index/) at the top of the r/Arduino\nposts feed and in our \"tools/reference\" sidebar panel.\nThe sidebar also has a selection of links to additional useful information and tools.\n\n\n\n## Moderator's Choices\n\n|Title|Author|Score|Comments|\n|---|---|--:|--:|\n|[Made an arduino-powered bird drone that...](/r/arduino/comments/11xzos2/made_an_arduinopowered_bird_drone_that_well_poops/)|u/doctabu|3,243|156|\n|[Arduino passed the farm test.

        "body": "Hi there!\n\nBeen struggling on a my first Arduino project.\n\nBasically I have a controller that is supposed to light up specific LEDs on a strip.\n\nMy current issue is that the LEDs do not light up, or in some cases, just the first one does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have attached a diagram of my current wiring setup  \n\n\n[Diagram](https://preview.redd.it/8ie0b43qmvxa1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f9db9199e98b1355a5845320a0e6603f87bc1fc)\n\nI am using:  \n\n\n* Nano 33 Sense Rev2 BLE\n* 5V WS2811 LEDs (200 of them)\n* Power supply is meanwell lpv-60-5\n* The NeoPixelBus library\n* Link to specific codebase I am using for this build [https://github.com/FabianRig/ArduinoMoonBoardLED](https://github.com/FabianRig/ArduinoMoonBoardLED)  \n\n\nBehaviour I am seeing:\n\n* Most of the time, nothing lights up after connecting and specifying lights to light up.\n* Oddly enough, sometimes the first LED will pop on if I mess with the ground or data pin. Colour is not always consistent. I can't 100% reliably make this happen every time\n\nThings I have tested\n\n* I bought a little strand tester online. It lights up all strings. Wanted to rule out the LEDs as the issue\n* Checked voltage at end of the LED lines - and looks good at 5v\n* Tried changing data pin in code and wiring to see if that helped at all\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a bit lost on what to look into next. Hoping someone wiser than me knows what I am doing wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple spitball ideas I had worth looking into maybe\n\n* I have seen some people mention that it could be a good idea to add a resister in data line to clean up signal a bit. Got one of those on order and waiting for it to show up\n* I also stumbled across some reading that perhaps the data line from the arduino is not 5v in my setup, and it may need to be? And I may need to add something in line there to pump from 3.3 to 5v. A bit over my head",

        "body": "I wanted to share with you all about the benefits of 3D-printed enclosures for our beloved Arduino Uno and Leonardo boards. As we all know, these boards are incredibly versatile and powerful, but they are also vulnerable to damage from dirt, dust, and shorts.\n\nFortunately, 3D printing technology has made it easier than ever to create custom enclosures for our Arduino boards. By enclosing our boards in a protective case, we can shield them from harmful elements and extend their lifespan.\n\nThere are many different types of 3D-printed enclosures available online, ranging from simple cases to more complex designs that include space for additional components such as sensors, LEDs, and buttons. Many of these designs are free and can be modified to suit our specific needs.\n\nSome of the benefits of using a 3D-printed enclosure for our Arduino boards include:\n\n1. Protection from dirt and dust: By enclosing our boards in a case, we can prevent dirt and dust from accumulating on the board and interfering with its functionality. This is particularly important for outdoor projects want or projects that involve a lot of movement or handling.\n2. Protection from damage: Accidents happen, and our Arduino boards are no exception. By placing them in an enclosure, we can help protect them from accidental drops, bumps, and scratches.\n3. Protection from shorts: One of the biggest risks to our Arduino boards is the possibility of a short circuit. By enclosing our boards in an insulated case, we can reduce the risk of a short circuit and help ensure our projects operate safely.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking to protect your Arduino Uno or Leonardo board from harm, I highly recommend investing in a 3D-printed enclosure. Not only will it keep your board safe, but it can also give your project a more professional and polished look.\n\nThe files were designed by: [https://www.taito3d.co.za/](https://www.taito3d.co.za/)\n\nThe files can be downloaded for free here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:194866](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:194866)",

The frequency can be adjusted using two tactile push-buttons,  with a 0.1MHz step size. The heart of the circuit is an ATMega8  microcontroller, which communicates with a 0.96-inch SPI OLED display  and the KT0803L FM transmitter chip via an I2C interface. You can  directly connect a microphone or an AUX cable to the board to broadcast  your desired sound, such as playing a piece of music from your  cellphone, computer, \u2026 etc. After conducting some tests, it was found  that the circuit operates quite stable, and the received sound is clear  and sharp.\n\nTo design the schematic and PCB, I used Altium Designer  23 and shared the project with my friends to get their feedback and  updates using Altium-365. The fast component search engine (Octopart)  allowed me to quickly consider components\u2019 information and also generate  the BOM. To get high-quality fabricated boards, I sent the Gerber files  to PCBWay. I am confident that utilizing this circuit will be an  enjoyable and fulfilling experience for you.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 [https://www.pcbway.com/blog/technology/Stereo\\_Digital\\_FM\\_Transmitter\\_Circuit\\_64d799f3.html](https://www.pcbway.com/blog/technology/Stereo_Digital_FM_Transmitter_Circuit_64d799f3.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqi0ngr1psxa1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=907d84adeff4267c5a1950b2d3bc4d63969978df",

This does not happen though, as seen in my serial monitor (photo 1), it does detect from <30 cm away. Im not sure at all on what's causing this, however i can see a few possibilities or things i did wrong:\n\nDoes it need DY Library (SnijderC) to work? Im currently not using any libraries\n\nIf it doesnt need the library then maybe its something with my code? The code is here: https://pastebin.com/2YhSnnDS\n\nDoes the SD card need to be formatted and only have the audio files for it to work? I use the SD card from my phone that contains my files (32gb card) and just placed the audio files in the main SD directory (photo 2)\n\nDid i name my audio files wrong?\n\nI got my files from X2Convert. cc, could that be a problem with downloaded MP3s? Ive had problems with Mp3s converted and downloaded from other sites in the past\n\nShould i just solder 22 AWG into the DY-SV5W? I dont really wanna mess anything up but the thing with this is that theres no way to tell whether the connection is secured or not (no led or anything)\n\nIs my DY-SV5W just broken \ud83d\udc80 i mean i was able to access the sd contents through micro usb but\n\nDo i have to turn up the volume?\n\nWould really appreciate help, and mybe further help through discord message \ud83d\ude2d thx smmm!!!!",

The general setup is shown in picture where VCC = 5V, SDA = A4, SCL = A5, and ADDR is connected to GND for setting address 0x48.\n\nI have tried three different (RobTillaar, Adafruit, and Jeff) tutorials (each with its own library) all having the same problem: they stuck on begin/initializing inside `setup()`, such as in RobTillaar example it is on `ADS.begin()`. \n\nI have experience in understanding and debugging C++ code. Tracing the problem I found out the issue is with I2C connection which I don't have experience on debugging this problem.\n\n[Current setup](https://preview.redd.it/j2wpw582xjxa1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4efc9729acd0d737315f9afb1bfc72e3c4753a5)\n\nHere you can see the exact line of code where the stuck (blocking) happens. It is on `twi_writeTo()` function in `twi.c` file. All three examples I follow (of course using different library each) all eventually point to this same problem (this is not the library/code issue, of course).

The Vmeasurement I do is 3.3V (which is under the VCC).\n\nFound in internet that I can trace the problem by using oscilloscope and learning in detail how I2C communicates. But I think that will take long time (days).\n\nI know ADS1115 is fragile and can easily be destroyed by wrong setup or accidentally touching random pin with 5V. As this thing is not cheap, I did carefully from beginning to make sure there is no short or wrong pin ever.\n\nMy question is: *how can I know my recently-purchased ADS1115 is defect (or is working perfectly fine) without having to learn I2C and debug using oscilloscope?*",

For instance, creating a web server in ESP32 using Arduino IDE requires less than 50 lines of code, while in ESP-IDF, it takes more than 100 neurons. Easy does not necessarily mean unprofessional, but I have been asking myself whether Arduino IDE is a professional IDE suitable for professional projects.

        "body": "EDIT: Issue fixed. Leaving the post for anyone in similar scenario. It was a compatibility issue between libraries in question and AS5600 library. Fix: First call as5600.begin() and then setup the Wire.setClock() and whatever settings you have. ( Do not call Wire.begin() yourself, as5600 does it). \n\nHello, I have an MPU6050 on the GY521 module. It's been acting weird. I'm building a drone for a project and I'm using i2cdev/MPU6050 library and my own code to use it is based on the MPU6050\\_DMP6 example. And it worked just fine, for some time, until after some reboot (what I mean is unplugging and plugging the power back in) it wasn't. I've been fighting that to no avail for hours yesterday. Today I had to redesign a drone a bit so I took it apart and put it back together. I test it and... it works. Worked just fine. Must have been some bad connection, I thought. So I'm doing some testing and developing and now, after some restart, the problem is back. I'm reading completely random values (with what looks like some pattern interestingly). On top of that read times slow down a lot and are super inconsistent. Like jumping between few ms to few hundred ms.\n\nI have no idea what is going on and what is causing this. It's the same with just arduino powered via usb or with entre drone powered with the battery. I tried unplugging one more sensor I have on the board that is connected to I2C as well. Nothing. The problem just showed up randomly and won't go away. Just like yesterday. Right now I'm waiting for like half an hour to make sure the capacitors discharge to see if maybe it's some bug with GY521 related to power cycling / quick restarts.\n\nIf anyone has encountered similar issues please let me know if and how You fixed them. It's for my dissertation project that is due 10 days from now.\n\nThese are the example values I get when reading Pitch Yaw Roll from stationary MPU6050 using the i2cdev lib when the problem is happening.

        "body": "I'm new to coding and after completing Paul McWorter's tutorials I turned to Bing's ChatGPT for help. Below is a section of our conversation. I understand what it wants me to change, but I don't understand why. I've tried asking it to clarify but it's just saying this over and over, as if this is obvious. Under what circumstances does \"stop\" start with \"f\".My questions are in bold.\n\nW**hat if I changed all the \"else if\" commands to \"if\" commands? Would it function differently?**\n\nYes, it would function differently. If you changed all the \u201celse if\u201d commands to \u201cif\u201d commands, the code would check every condition even if one of them was already true. This could cause some problems if the input matches more than one condition. *For example, if the input is \u201cf\u201d, it would match both the condition for \u201cforward\u201d and the condition for \u201cstop\u201d. This could make the robot move forward and stop at the same time, which is not what you want. Using \u201celse if\u201d commands ensures that only one block of code is executed for each input.*\n\n**Why would input \"f\" match the conditon for \"stop\"?**\n\nBecause you have written the condition for \u201cstop\u201d as:\n\n    else if (input==\"stop\" || input==\"x\") \n\nThis means that the code will execute if the input is equal to \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cx\u201d. However, the input is converted to lower case before the comparison, so \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cStop\u201d and \u201cSTOP\u201d are all considered the same. Therefore, if the input is \u201cf\u201d, it will match the first letter of \u201cstop\u201d and trigger the condition. To avoid this, you should either use single quotes to compare characters instead of strings, or use a different command for \u201cstop\u201d that does not start with \u201cf\u201d.\n\n**\"stop\" starts with \"s\" not \"f\". Right?**\n\nYes, you are right. \u201cstop\u201d starts with \u201cs\u201d not \u201cf\u201d. However, the input is converted to lower case before the comparison, so \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cStop\u201d and \u201cSTOP\u201d are all considered the same. Therefore, if the input is \u201cf\u201d, it will match the first letter of \u201cstop\u201d and trigger the condition. This is because you are using double quotes to compare strings instead of single quotes to compare characters. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes, such as \u201chello\u201d or \u201cstop\u201d. Characters are single symbols enclosed in single quotes, such as \u2018h\u2019 or \u2018s\u2019. When you compare strings, you are checking if they are exactly the same. When you compare characters, you are checking if they have the same value. For example:\n\n    if (input == \"s\") {   // this will be true only if the input is exactly \"s\" }  \n    if (input == 's') {   // this will be true if the input is any string that starts with 's' } \n\nTo avoid this problem, you should either use single quotes to compare characters instead of strings, or use a different command for \u201cstop\u201d that does not start with \u201cf\u201d.",

However they demonstrate this technique with a fixed pattern (the letter \"E\"), what I do not understand is how you can specify the timing a custom pattern must be shown. E.g: show \"E\" for five seconds, after that show \"A\" for three seconds, after that show \"B\" for four seconds...\n\nCan anybody help me with this and possibly clarify with a simple beginner-friendly code example?\n\nBest regards",

        "body": "Greetings everyone!  \n\nI am working on building a sensor using Arduino Nano 33 BLE that will measure temperature using two thermistors and angle changes. The measured values will be transmitted over Bluetooth to a smartphone every minute. I have written the code for temperature and angle measurements, as well as remote data transfer. However, I need this sensor to operate for 10 to 21 days on a 3.7v 250mAH battery. To achieve this, I planned to use the Arduino low-power library.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to find a library that is compatible with this Arduino board, nor have I found an example of how to put the board into sleep mode and then measure values every minute. I am aware of the option to power the board directly from a 3.3v source by cutting the 3.3V pads on the back of the board, disabling the power indication diode and turning off the sensors/the I2C pull-up resistors.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions or solutions to this problem.

He lives several towns over so it's not like I can run a cable to his house.\n\nFor this I'm trying to figure out a way for the Arduino to communicate to his phone. I think the easiest way would be to do it over internet but he would have to get the service installed in the basement and get a plan. Another method I can think of is cellular though I would need to look into data plans. That's two I can think of but I want to make sure I'm not missing other options while I assemble a proposal/quote.\n\nI'm considering using an Arduino, though I'm considering other hardware and softwarr depending on what I can come up with.

Thanks!\n\nEdit: After a bit of testing, whenever I unplug the arduino, plug it back in, then reopen the serial monitor, it tells me it\u2019s on a different serial port (acm0-acm1 and vice versa).

Everything I send to the screens appears perfectly on both screens. This was a surprising result because I had always learned that 2 devices cannot use the same i2c address without causing collisions.\n\nTo me, there seems to be only 2 possible explanations, and I'm curious which one is correct, or if there's another solution I'm not seeing. Either (1) the screens do not send any information back to the Arduino, they only receive data, or (2), they do send some data back, but they coincidentally are always sending it in perfect unison so they never notice a collision with each other.\n\nI find the second explanation to be less believable, but I'm curious to know why this setup works so perfectly. Could this be reliably expanded? If I for some reason wanted to build something that had 5 or more screens that all displayed the same information, could I just keep adding on more screens that share the same i2c address?",

This would be pretty easy for Minecraft and probably some Steam games with workshop support, but those like Warframe or Fortnite might need to take data from what's being displayed on screen via TensorFlow or some other AI algorithm. (That'll need to be checked in another group) \n\nBack to the hardware, I know I'll need fans to dispense the smells, but apart from some Nanos and motors, I'm not too sure what else could be used (or where to get them).\n\nI don't know how often this subreddit deals with master-to-slave communications, but this is probably one of those times. Apart from Klipper, I've never messed with controlling Audrinos or other microcontrollers via a host. could use some help in that regard. (I guess this falls under both hardware and software help but I can only flair for one...)",

After converting AWAY from the CO2 pressurized approach (worked well but had some long term/end user issues...  so things have been converted over to 'pumps').\n\nIssue with the pumps is:   \n\\* not each pump has consistent output based on same timing intervals  \n\\* I noticed that the pumps to NOT keep the lines full/primed,and that it will over time leak back into the pump and then back into the ingredient/liquid container  \n\n\n* I initially though a simple check valve would work (havent been able to find one that is not pressurized output, just a simple 'gravity' swing gate type that was small enough for use with 3/8\" x 1/4\" silicone tubing)\n* looked into using a flow sensor to log flow/output..  but upon reading that are not very 'accurate', and can be inaccurate based on flow rate, pressure..etc.  (also wasnt sure how I'd get all 8 lines into '1' line for the flow meter output portion)\n* In the end it seems that 'weighing' is the most accurate path to pursue here...  hence the load cell end point (right now) :)\n\nI have never used or played with these 'load cells' before..   Most I see if these 'long bar' types?  (seems like it might be just 'too' big for it be under a cup  (that moves around getting filled)\n\nMy current test is thing one:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GQPV6C4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GQPV6C4)\n\nbut not sure if I try to source a 1kg one vs this 5kg one?    I am looking to measure things down to .25oz   (at the very least)\n\nThen I started to fall down the path of single point..bending, compression versions?  (lost me)\n\nI then stumbled upon these type of load cells?  (different physical design)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C7GH5BP](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C7GH5BP)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/DYHW-116-Compression-Force-Sensor-Applicable/dp/B07H23LFPY](https://www.amazon.com/DYHW-116-Compression-Force-Sensor-Applicable/dp/B07H23LFPY)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TQ6HPT3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TQ6HPT3)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Miniature-Tension-Compression-Riveting-Laminator/dp/B08C73DFCK](https://www.amazon.com/Miniature-Tension-Compression-Riveting-Laminator/dp/B08C73DFCK)\n\nthey caught my eye because of the physical design (size) DIFFERENCE.. which I thought my be better to suit my project (hide this under the (moving) cup holder)..\n\nI am looking for some feedback on using load cells in general (accuracy?  worth it?)  How close of of the 2kg, 5kg, 20kg versions should you get to your max load/weight?  (does it matter if I use a 2okg one? vs a 1kg or 5kg?  will I still be able to weigh things down to a .25 oz limit?)  \n\n\nAnyone use these alternative ones?  Size?   thoughts on it working with a cup holder to measure the current output of liquid?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuess I'll start here!   Thanks!",

I got it working the way I wanted with Serial.print, but I've run into a couple issues when I tried to swtich over to an LCD screen.\n\nI am currently using on/off toggle switches in my project because I was having trouble with push buttons because of storing variables etc, and as soon as I tried the toggles, everything worked.  When I flip a toggle ON, the first few characters print clearly, but towards the end of the line, the characters become dimmer.  When I flip the toggle switch to OFF, all of the characters display brightly.\n\nI tried the same length of message with a modified program and a push button, and everything displays perfectly.  I thought that it might be an issue with the toggle itself, so I swapped it for another (same thing).  I also tried replacing the toggle with a wire and connecting/disconnecting it (same issue).  I also tried the same thing on a different microcontroller (same thing happens).  I am using LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library, and I read that it doesn't work with all projects, but I haven't been able to find any documentation on an issue like this.\n\nUltimately, I can just switch what I tell the program is \"Off\" and \"on\" so that it displays correctly, but I am still curious about this issue.

        "body": "Hi All,  \nI just pulled an old MKR 1000 I had laying around out for some project work, which would require it to be powered off battery.\n\nHowever, the Lipo batteries I had on hand didn't seem to charge off the JST port on the MKR. I figured the Lipos were old (sitting for at least a year or so) and ordered a couple others (larger capacity too, just for kicks) and same result there. No charging light at all, with any of the four batteries I tried. \n\nImportantly, I know it did work with my existing lipos previously, because I used them together in the last project I used the MKR board in. So I believe the polarity and everything is fine, just in case if I'm looking down onto the top of the MKR board these lipos all have their ground on the left-hand side of the JST connector.\n\nI've gone ahead and started building my sketch despite the battery issue, so I also know all the other functionality I've tested is working without issue on the MKR. That includes WiFi, RTC, an SPI display, rotary encoder/interrupts, etc. The other LEDs on the board also light up fine.\n\nI tried to find a way to check the battery voltage/current flow from the MKR itself but it doesn't seem that's support on the MKR 1000. Is the MKR board I have bad? Is there a fuse or other component I can replace to see if it restores battery function?\n\nIf not, I guess my options are to either order a new MKR 1000 for my project, or just get a battery pack that outputs 3.3v or 5v and run it into the board. Hoping to fix what I've got on-hand before I go that route though.",

It all works well close to the IR receiver but does not work from a distance (even though it looks like the receiver is reacting when I click the button). \n\nQuestions\n1.Does it have a range limitation? I'm assuming yes based on my testing\n2. Is there anyway to extend the range? I'm assuming no\n3. Is there a more powerful IR receiver (or is it the remote) that I should get so I can do it from a further distance (up to 10 feet?) \n\nThank you!!",

The idea is to add, among other things, a cheap microcontroller (ATMega328PB?), a switch, and a power-plus-I2C connector (e.g. QWIIC, STEMMA QT..), and end up with an I2C MIDI port that can be either In or Out, but can't switch while it's powered on (for idiot proofing).\n\nFor any TLDR types who would rather criticize the whole concept than help:  I ***know*** it would be easier/cheaper to add just another jack and make it a full TRS or DIN MIDI In/Out device.  If that's your comment, please don't.\n\nAnd by 'Can this work?' I mean, can I make it work without a load of parts on a huge board.  The idea is to make it fairly cheap and small, with the PCB not much wider than a MIDI connector and hopefully shorter than the width of an average hand (100-120 mm).\n\nIt would be used for experimenting with MIDI and any dev board that has an I2C port.  On power up, the on-board micro detects the direction switch position, sets In or Out with SEL, then pulls OE\\* low to enable the multiplexer output.  This attaches the two active pins of the MIDI connector to the proper circuitry, then sends ***or*** receives MIDI over the I2C line.\n\nI know there's a voltage problem, with many dev boards being 3.3 volts these days.  I'm thinking of adding a level converter, and that's probably the answer.  I'll add a power jack, and a way to power it over I2C if that's 5v (and a MOSFET to isolate it if it's not).  Other options are USB power (easy with less parts) or a battery with a regulator and possibly boost converter (way more parts than I want...).\n\nBut what I'm wondering about is the Mux.  I have no idea how it will affect the MIDI signal.  It has pretty good ESD protection on its own, so not really worried about that.  Will the internal impedances of the chip degrade the MIDI signal too much?  I'm not asking anyone to download the data sheet and give me specifics, but if you have experience with this kind of thing (multiplexing a current loop data stream), I'd be very glad to hear any insights you have.\n\nThe switch will probably be momentary.  The firmware will default to MIDI In (most likely to be tested), but switch to MIDI Out if it senses the switch being pressed at power on.  TRS jacks have the advantage of models with a contact that opens when the plug is inserted.  That would make possible allowing In/Out changes when MIDI wasn't connected but power is still on.  I've never seen a DIN jack with this feature, but I have to believe they exist.  If you know of one, please let me know.\n\nAm I crazy to try this?  Probably.  But it's something I'd really like to see done.  And I'd much rather see comments on the circuit design than on my general state of sanity, please.",

        "body": "Hi All,\n\nI have an Adafruit Feather 32u4 that I'm trying to put into idle mode and wake up every 5 seconds with a timer interrupt. My problem is that the board doesn't appear to ever enter idle mode. Here's my code for it:\n\n```\n#include <avr/sleep.h>\n\nISR (TIMER1_COMPA_vect){\n  SMCR &= (0 << SE); // disable sleep\n  digitalWrite(8, HIGH); // turn on green LED to show that ISR has executed\n  delay(500);\n}\n\n// Configure timer as a compare match, reset on compare match, with a 5s period\nvoid setup_timer(){\n  cli(); // disable interrupts\n  TCCR1A = 0; // set all bits in Timer/Counter1 Control Register A to 0 \n  TCCR1B = 0; // set all bits in Timer/Counter2 Control Register B to 0\n  TCNT1 = 0; // initialize all counter bits to 0\n  OCR1A = 8000000/1024 * 5; // set Output Compare Register1 value\n  TCCR1B =  (1 << WGM12) | (1 << CS12) | (1 << CS10); // Clear timer on compare match, prescaler 1/1024\n  TIMSK1 = (1 << OCIE1A); // Timer1 compare match A interrupt\n  sei(); // enable interrupts\n\n}\nvoid setup() {\n \n  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // configure built-in LED as output\n  pinMode(8, OUTPUT); // configure pin8 LED as output\n\n  SMCR = (0 << SM2) | (0 << SM1) | (0 << SM0); // Set SM2..0 bits to 000 to configure idle mode\n  delay(5000);\n  setup_timer();\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  delay(1000);\n  digitalWrite(8, LOW); // turn off green LED\n  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // turn off built-in LED to show that the MCU has entered idle mode\n  SMCR |= (1 << SE); // enable sleep\n  sleep_cpu(); // send SLEEP instruction\n  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn on built-in LED to show that MCU has woken up\n}\n\n\n```\n\nThe LED I have set up to test whether Idle Mode is working is not acting as I would expect if the device were successfully being put to sleep. Based off of the section on sleep and power management in the ATmega32u4 [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/atmel-7766-8-bit-avr-atmega16u4-32u4_datasheet.pdf) (section 7), I expected that the LED would be turned off right before the sleep instruction is sent. The LED would remain off until the interrupt triggered and the ISR was executed, after which the code would resume execution at the line immediately following the sleep instruction. This is where I turn the LED on. The actual result I'm getting is that the LED appears to never turn off, like the sleep instruction is being skipped and so the interval between the LED being turned off and turned back on again isn't long enough to see.\n\nI'm interpreting this to mean that I probably didn't configure the Sleep Mode Control Register (SMCR) correctly. I tried changing the line where I set the configuration bits in the SMCR to the configuration for low power mode, which should turn off the clock to the timer as well as to the CPU once the Sleep instruction is sent, but that isn't working as expected either.\n\nIf someone could take a look and see where/how I'm messing this up I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks in advance!",

These lines are normall held\n  * high at 5V.  When a 0 is sent, DATA0 drops to 0V for a few us.  When a 1 is sent, DATA1 drops\n  * to 0V for a few us.  There is usually a few ms between the pulses.\n  *\n  * Your reader should have at least 4 connections (some readers have more).  Connect the Red wire \n  * to 5V.  Connect the black to ground.  Connect the green wire (DATA0) to Digital Pin 2 (INT0).  \n  * Connect the white wire (DATA1) to Digital Pin 3 (INT1).  That's it!\n  *\n  * Operation is simple - each of the data lines are connected to hardware interrupt lines.  When\n  * one drops low, an interrupt routine is called and some bits are flipped.  After some time of\n  * of not receiving any bits, the Arduino will decode the data.  I've only added the 26 bit and\n  * 35 bit formats, but you can easily add more.\n  \n */\n  \n  \n #define MAX_BITS 100                 // max number of bits \n #define WEIGAND_WAIT_TIME  3000      // time to wait for another weigand pulse.  \n  \n unsigned char databits[MAX_BITS];    // stores all of the data bits\n unsigned char bitCount;              // number of bits currently captured\n unsigned char flagDone;              // goes low when data is currently being captured\n unsigned int weigand_counter;        // countdown until we assume there are no more bits\n  \n unsigned long facilityCode=0;        // decoded facility code\n unsigned long cardCode=0;            // decoded card code\n  \n // interrupt that happens when INTO goes low (0 bit)\n void ISR_INT0()\n {\n   //Serial.print(\"0\");   // uncomment this line to display raw binary\n   bitCount++;\n   flagDone = 0;\n   weigand_counter = WEIGAND_WAIT_TIME;  \n  \n }\n  \n // interrupt that happens when INT1 goes low (1 bit)\n void ISR_INT1()\n {\n   //Serial.print(\"1\");   // uncomment this line to display raw binary\n   databits[bitCount] = 1;\n   bitCount++;\n   flagDone = 0;\n   weigand_counter = WEIGAND_WAIT_TIME;  \n }\n  \n void setup()\n {\n   pinMode(13, OUTPUT);  // LED\n   pinMode(2, INPUT);     // DATA0 (INT0)\n   pinMode(3, INPUT);     // DATA1 (INT1)\n  \n   Serial.begin(9600);\n   Serial.println(\"RFID Readers\");\n  \n   // binds the ISR functions to the falling edge of INTO and INT1\n   attachInterrupt(0, ISR_INT0, FALLING);  \n   attachInterrupt(1, ISR_INT1, FALLING);\n  \n  \n   weigand_counter = WEIGAND_WAIT_TIME;\n }\n  \n void loop()\n {\n   // This waits to make sure that there have been no more data pulses before processing data\n   if (!flagDone) {\n     if (--weigand_counter == 0)\n       flagDone = 1;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n   }\n  \n   // if we have bits and we the weigand counter went out\n   if (bitCount > 0 && flagDone) {\n     unsigned char i;\n  \n     Serial.print(\"Read \");\n     Serial.print(bitCount);\n     Serial.print(\" bits. \");\n  \n     // we will decode the bits differently depending on how many bits we have\n     // see www.pagemac.com/azure/data_formats.php for mor info\n     if (bitCount == 35)\n     {\n       // 35 bit HID Corporate 1000 format\n       // facility code = bits 2 to 14\n       for (i=2; i<14; i++)\n       {\n          facilityCode <<=1;\n          facilityCode |= databits[i];\n       }\n  \n       // card code = bits 15 to 34\n       for (i=14; i<34; i++)\n       {\n          cardCode <<=1;\n          cardCode |= databits[i];\n       }\n  \n       printBits();\n     }\n     else if (bitCount == 26)\n     {\n       // standard 26 bit format\n       // facility code = bits 2 to 9\n       for (i=1; i<9; i++)\n       {\n          facilityCode <<=1;\n          facilityCode |= databits[i];\n       }\n  \n       // card code = bits 10 to 23\n       for (i=9; i<25; i++)\n       {\n          cardCode <<=1;\n          cardCode |= databits[i];\n       }\n  \n       printBits();  \n     }\n     else {\n       // you can add other formats if you want!\n      Serial.println(\"Unable to decode.\"); \n     }\n  \n      // cleanup and get ready for the next card\n      bitCount = 0;\n      facilityCode = 0;\n      cardCode = 0;\n      for (i=0; i<MAX_BITS; i++) \n      {\n        databits[i] = 0;\n      }\n   }\n }\n  \n void printBits()\n {\n       // I really hope you can figure out what this function does\n       Serial.print(\"FC = \");\n       Serial.print(facilityCode);\n       Serial.print(\", CC = \");\n       Serial.println(cardCode); \n }",

This is my first major project  I've taken on, and honestly it has all gone well until this point and I've learnt so much!   \n\n\nFor anyone who knows of it, I've installed Loopy's controller mod on two original Nintendo DS's and hooked them up to an SNES controller.  It works perfectly on its own when only *one* of the consoles is attached to the SNES controller, but when two are attached I get occasional random \"button\" presses like A or the Right Shoulder button. I can only assume this is data interference from the mod chips interacting with each other or sharing the connection?   \n\n\nIs there any way I can use an arduino to clean this up and act as a hub between the mods and the controller? Or, better yet, I'm stuck for ideas and don't know what direction I'm supposed to research this.  \n\n\nAny help or advice on what I should look into would help a lot!",

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\nBackground: I am attempting to collect air pollution data hourly for 3 months at a remote site. I am using an Arduino UNO for the board, a PMS5003 for the sensor, and an ESP8266-01 Wifi Shield both to sync time with an NTP server ([pool.ntp.org](https://pool.ntp.org)) and to upload collected data to Thingspeak. I am using an ESP for timesync rather than an RTC module because I would like to dedicate the 5V power solely to the sensor for better accuracy. \n\nMy circuit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bw3rg786sjwa1.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6377ce6dacd905ecadb1e3c7200337301ad5f628\n\nLink to full code (quite long and complex, and the area where the problem occurs is included further below): [https://github.com/throwaway3141/air-sensing-hourly/blob/main/PMSLibraryFullCode.ino](https://github.com/throwaway3141/air-sensing-hourly/blob/main/PMSLibraryFullCode.ino)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current method: Every time the clock hits 55 minutes, the sensor should \"wake up\", giving it 5 minutes of buffer time before it reads data. At the 60 minute mark (aka the start of the new hour) the sensor should then read data, send it, and go back to sleep. As such, I sync the Arduino to realtime from the NTP server ***every 1 minute in the loop****,* a frequency which is convenient for hourly data recording and slow enough for the ESP to relay without lag. Once the current minute is 54 or 59, I then switch to a short manual delay using millis() in order to align the remaining seconds exactly with 55 or 60 minutes, and then perform an action (wake or read-sleep). I am aware that this may not be the best way to code this output-- please tell me if there are easier/better solutions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem: After around 45 minutes (so around 45 timesync command cycles), the **ESP8266-01 simply fails to become available**. In other words, after running the timesync commands enough times, the ESP seems to shut down, despite working in the first few iterations. Specifically, this occurs in the function which retrieves time from the NTP server: the line ***while(!esp8266.available()) {}*** never leaves the loop.\n\n    unsigned long getTimeEpochUnix() {\n      unsigned long secsSince1900 = 0UL; //Since we only care about time of day and not date, this isn't really necessary. But we might as well get the full time right anyway\n    \n      sendCommand(\"AT+CIPSTART=\\\"UDP\\\",\\\"\"+ TIME_HOST +\"\\\",\"+ TIME_PORT, 15, \"OK\"); //NOT STRICTLY NECESSARY IF ALREADY CONNECTED?\n      sendCommand(\"AT+CIPSEND=48\", 5, \"OK\");\n      \n      emptyESP_RX(1000UL);\n      esp8266.write((char*)&ntpFirstFourBytes, NTP_PACKET_SIZE);  // Request\n    \n      // skip  AT command answer (\"Recv 48 bytes\\r\\n\\r\\nSEND OK\\r\\n\\r\\n+IPD,48:\")\n      waitForString(\":\", 1000UL);\n    \n      // read the NTP packet, extract the TRANSMIT TIMESTAMP in Seconds from bytes 40,41,42,43\n      for (int i = 0; i < NTP_PACKET_SIZE; i++) {\n        unsigned long cT = 0;\n        unsigned long lT = millis();\n        while (!esp8266.available()) {}\n        int c = esp8266.read();\n        if ((i >= 40) && (i < 44)) secsSince1900 = (secsSince1900 << 8) + (unsigned long)((uint8_t)(c & (int)0x00FF));  // Read the integer part of sending time\n        else if (i == 44) secsSince1900 += (((uint8_t)c) > SECONDROUNDINGTHRESHOLD ? 1 : 0);\n      }\n    \n      epochUnix = secsSince1900 - SEVENTYYEARS; // subtract seventy years. Again, since we only care time of day, this isn't strictly necessary.\n    \n    \n      sendCommand(\"AT+CIPCLOSE\",5,\"OK\");\n      return epochUnix + UTC_DELTA;\n    }\n\nI initially thought the problem to be with hardware voltage, but after checking resistors and confirming power output with a voltmeter, I doubt this is the case. I have also tried executing AT+RESET in the while loop() after a certain period of unavailability, and although this occasionally works, it is too inconsistent to be a feasible solution. It could be possible that the error lies somewhere in the methodology of the specific code used to unpack the timeserver data: this code was largely copied off a [demo](https://forum.arduino.cc/uploads/short-url/A7mrAs3rpCZuUwhIpjxLKpMFa7B.ino), and I'm somewhat unsure how it works.\n\nThank you for reading; any help would be massively appreciated.",

        "body": "Hi there,\n\nI am working with [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097T3SX6W) load cell module (I'm using 4 sensors together with one amp board) and I'm getting some undesired results. As far as I know, mounting, wiring, and code are all correct. The system was working fine before I made a recent change, which was just switching out the red load cell wires soldered directly into the amp board for reusable pins.\n\nThe problem now is that the output from the load cell just gradually increases from 0 over time. For example, after 30 seconds it may have increased  to 0.5 lb, after 60 seconds it may have increased to 1.0 lb, etc. I can still press on the cantilevers and get a load response, then it returns back to the previous value once released.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is some electromagnetic noise through the wires, but I don't know why that would cause an accumulating output value rather than just random signal noise. I don't think there's any shorting or loose wiring anywhere. Does anyone have any insight on this? \n\nFor context, I am using the original wiring with 3\" solid-wire extensions soldered to the ends to make them easier to stick into the reusable pins soldered into the amp board. The sensors are in a square configuration about 12\" apart.",

[https://github.com/nuggetbucket54/CanSat](https://github.com/nuggetbucket54/CanSat)\n\nOur payload theoretically measured air pressure and temperature as it descended from the rocket. Additionally, we came up with a secondary mission using an MPU6050 to measure seismic activity of the launchsite.\n\nUnfortunately, the rocket pre-maturely blew up and broke our payload, limiting the amount of information we were able to record. Thus, most of our information comes from the payload as it sat prior to the launch of the rocket.\n\nTo increase the accuracy, I created a Fourier transform to try and limit the system noise from the MPU6050. The general process was based off something researched by the Japanese Meterological Agency ([https://www-data-jma-go-jp.translate.goog/eqev/data/kyoshin/kaisetsu/calc\\_sindo.html?\\_x\\_tr\\_sl=auto&\\_x\\_tr\\_tl=en&\\_x\\_tr\\_hl=en-US](https://www-data-jma-go-jp.translate.goog/eqev/data/kyoshin/kaisetsu/calc_sindo.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US))\n\nHere are just some matplotlib graphs of our data, but more about our findings, the CanSat itself, and the code can be found in the repo. Some other information about setting up the code is also available:\n\n[Altitude vs Time \\(we only got a single packet during the launch, in which the altitude suddenly spikes](https://preview.redd.it/c7p9xbn04bwa1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d64ada0d96b7f4eb1294483b0d14fd4a3023c3a)\n\n[Pressure vs Time \\(pressure suddenly dips during rocket launch\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ih3mgt864bwa1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb93b2560f0a3626ee0e121ea7660ea3e4386bf2)\n\n[Seismometer data, spikes likely came from moving the rocket to the launchsite and launching the rocket](https://preview.redd.it/a58r435n2bwa1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=64a0ca5dc0dcbdd752b8f11eef2e227d090a4131)\n\nWould love to hear everyone's thoughts",

        "body": "A few months ago I got an Elegoo Smart Car to learn Arduino, and I've made some modifications to get better functionality that worked well. But I tried to rebuild the Obstacle Avoidance functionality that has hit a snag. The way I want the code to work is that the car should look in each direction, then drive forward for a short time. It should then stop, and repeat. But whenever I run the code what happens is that it works the first loop, drives forward, and then gets stuck in a loop of constantly turning right. It does this no matter which direction the camera is facing, which I feel like shouldn't be the case. I feel like the issue is probably something obvious I just don't understand enough about coding to work out.\n\nThe lines I've changed now read:\n\nfor (uint8\\_t i = 1; i <6; i +=2) //Omnidirectional detection of obstacle avoidance status  \n {  \n AppServo.DeviceDriverSet\\_Servo\\_control(30 \\* i); //Sets the angle to be looked at in sets of 60 degrees.

So turn a non electronic keybed into something electronic that sends digital messages to music equipment.\n\nI want the keys to be velocity sensitive (which means information is collected on how quickly the key is pressed). I\u2019ve read about it being done with 2 switches at different heights, and then calculating the velocity based on the time difference of them being pressed. But I was wondering whether you could feasibly do this with one proximity sensor. Basically differentiating the position to get a velocity value or whatever. Are there affordable sensors that accurately measure distances in a range of 2-10 cm? Preferably not something that takes a lot of time calibrate, because it\u2019ll be about 30 keys that\u2019ll get a sensor :P.\n\nOr if I\u2019m thinking about it in a way to costly or contrived way, please send me in the right direction.\n\nThanks!",

I will try to be thorough as I know that lack of info is what frustrates most of those trying to respond.

I am providing the other 5V from the arduino board. Pin 2 on main board goes to DIR pin on driver. Pin 3 on main goes to STEP pin on driver. I followed instructions on the video to set my amperage output on the driver to .6 volts (VREF) as the [motor itself](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TGJSRGZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) is 1.5amp rated.

(while not a huge difference.. its roughly .25-.50 oz difference).. \n\n2.) full lines/hoses... when using the CO2 approach.. the lines were full 100% of the time... when using pumps.. they prime, and get full..  but then after not being on, it seems that the liquid is flowing back -into- the pump.. and then back into the source ingredient container?  So when turning on the pump again.. you get a slightly different output because the line is not full.\n\nAnd -this- is why I am here! :)  Hopefully to get some feedback on a QUICK and EASY (and cheap/affordable solution to address this.    What better place to go than other people who do projects like this!\n\nSo.. my first thought:\n\n* maybe some sort of tiny 'check valve' that can go on the line BEFORE the pump? (like it hangs on the hose/line that is dropped into the ingredient container?  (would have to be small..since 2-liter opening would be the smallest opening to deal with I believe?\n* check valve would have to be a no pressure one I am guessing?  (simple value with swinging/toggle wall?) since no CO2 pressure anymore.. and simple pump, you wont get much of any pressure I'm guessing.\n* perhaps a different type of pump then to address this? one does that not allow back-flow?  \n\n\nMy first time messing with pumps really, so kinda out of my comfort zone here\n\nstupid little mock-up image.. (for a visual look) of how the lines on the back go into the ingredient containers.. pumps/sucks up the liquid, through the pump.. and the outputs it up/over the backside.. into a 90 degree elbow... that drops it straight down into a cup.  of course the 90 degree/straight portion will never keep liquid. (unless pump keeps up some sort of priming/vaccuum?)\n\nBut the rest falling back down into the pump and then back into the ingredient container is an issue for consistent output.\n\nAnyone have experience with no pressure check valves?  Offer some other ideas to look into?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xrsee5p32wa1.png?width=235&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f6e5e9642a39a9755bed515596846b6b4f78ec9\n\nThanks",

It lights up and fires off a voice line when it detects motion. I'd love to be able to add up to date voice lines to it, and if I were really ambitious, I'd add a microphone and play around with voice commands. However, my understanding is that it isn't really possible to reprogram the existing stuff. There's a USB port, but I think it only goes to the battery. So I'm looking to basically remake the thing with some improvements. I have an arduino starter kit, but I don't think that would be enough, if even any of it would work. So I'm wondering what arduino parts would be best for something like this. From a quick search, it looks like maybe the Nicla Voice would work? Though I don't know what kind of programmability that has. A major constraint is that the board can be a max of about 2 inches by 2 inches.",

Static num for testing\n        int FanController;\n    \n        if (TotalVal == 4){\n          FanController = 255;\n          delay (10000);   \n                 \n        }\n        else if (TotalVal == 3){\n          FanController = 255;\n          delay(10000);\n          FanController = 0;\n          delay (3000);\n          \n        }\n        else if (TotalVal == 2){\n          FanController = 255;\n          delay(5000);\n          FanController = 0;\n          delay(5000);\n        }\n        else if (TotalVal == 1) {\n          FanController = 255;\n          delay(3000);\n          FanController = 0;\n          delay(10000);\n        }\n        else if (TotalVal == 0) {\n          FanController = 0;\n          delay(10000);\n        }\n\nps, im a noob :)\n\n[Original source code](https://pastebin.com/HFj8anvu) | [Fixed code](https://pastebin.com/pV53kJfc)\n\n&#x200B;",

I use a hardware interrupt on my Arduino Uno and have written a function to increment the variable if the knob in turned CW, and opposite if the know is turned CCW.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes when I reach the lower limit of my range by design the variable should remain at that limit if the know is continuously turned CCW but in reality I see it increment one step from time to time and I can't figure it out.\n\nHere's the code: (important bits, I omitted the main loop):\n\n // Rotary encoder pins  \n\\#define encoder0PinA 3  \n\\#define encoder0PinB 4  \n\\#define encoder0Btn 5\n\n \n\nvoid setup() {\n\npinMode(encoder0PinA, INPUT\\_PULLUP);  \n pinMode(encoder0PinB, INPUT\\_PULLUP);  \n pinMode(encoder0Btn, INPUT\\_PULLUP);  \n attachInterrupt(1, doEncoder, FALLING);\n\n}\n\n \n\nvoid doEncoder() {  \n if (millis() - last\\_run > 25) {   \n if (digitalRead(encoder0PinB) == LOW) { //encoder is turning CW  \nencoder0Pos += stepsize;  \n if (encoder0Pos > Target\\_max) encoder0Pos = Target\\_max;  \n }  \n else { //encoder is turning CCW  \n if (encoder0Pos >= stepsize)  \n {  \nencoder0Pos -= stepsize;  \n }  \n }  \nlast\\_run = millis();  \n }  \n}",

I have an idea to make a PVC tower that looks similar to one of those metal patio heaters with two different colored lights on top that can be toggled with a 3 way switch. Another idea I had is having something like a chess timer where the time is tracked for how long one team has their light active. This way it's not just \"kill the other team until I say stop\". It's a simple idea but airsofters are simple creatures, you can give them an empty cat litter jug with some rocks in it and tell them to protect it for 15 minutes and they will fully commit to their new mission. Something like as simple as a toggled light with a timer would blow their minds simply because it's a change from what I feel like every field boils down to...team death match and bomb games. My problem is I don't really know what can be done with Arduinos and how I could continue to build off of this idea with one. Not even sure if I'd even need one yet I'm still in the spitballing phase.\nAny ideas of how I could get this done? Or maybe different things I could do to make a better prop?",

When I plug a servo in while the Arduino is powered it will move a little bit. One time I got a servo to move approximately 30\u00b0 and then it never worked again. Any help would be appreciated, if more details are required I would be happy to provide them. I am very new to Arduino but have experience with Python so I would generally think it is an issue with the hardware. This is for a school project. \n\nSorry about formatting I\u2019m doing this from my phone as I am laying in bed unable to sleep thinking about this issue.",

They look something like this.  If(specific button is pressed){set angle to 90 degrees}.  The problem is that it only makes the servo move into position for 1 second and then return to the neutral position because the button is no longer being pressed.  How could I fix it so that the servo stays until another button is pressed?\n\nUPDATE: I did this by setting a variable to the previous position if a button is not being pressed. However, my problem now is that when I start the Arduino, the position is 0 degrees which I cannot have because the servo will break off.  What can I do to make the position 90 degrees when no button has been pressed?",

I didn't do enough research before soldering some things up. \n\nI'm using an m0 board (adafruit feather m0 proto: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772)) to control an nRF24l sub-board ([https://www.addicore.com/NRF24L01-PA-LNA-p/ad269.htm](https://www.addicore.com/NRF24L01-PA-LNA-p/ad269.htm)). So I stuck some female headers into the proto area and soldered those to their proper pins. Because I didn't do enough research it turns out that best practice is to include a capacitor between the power and ground on the nRF24l. Rather than disassemble all of this and rework it. I was thinking I could probably just sort of tack on my capacitor on top of the nRF24l board's vcc/gnd headers.\n\nHowever I don't know enough about electrical theory to know if that would have the same effect of putting the capacitor between the vcc/gnd before it even gets to the board. My first thought is that the capacitor kind of acts like a kind of power reservoir to smooth out any bumps in the supply. I think just soldering it onto the back of the pins should have the same effect: it should charge up when power is abundant and should discharge into the board if power dips.\n\nThanks for any insight.",

I am hoping to create a personalized 3D printed keyboard specifically for use with Procreate. Ideally, the keyboard would have a Bluetooth connection and12 keys, along with two potentiometers. While I'm confident in my ability to design and print the keyboard, I could use some guidance on the electronic components necessary for this project.\n\nMy plan is to use an Arduino Nano and an HM-10 Bluetooth module, along with several keys and two potentiometers. However, I'm not entirely sure which specific components to purchase or how to ensure their compatibility with iOS. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

        "body": "Hi, i've this issue where multiple button presses are registerd during a delay event.\n\nIve seen online that delay function stops the program from reading any input (what i want) but that doesnt happen in real life.\n\nThe idea is that when both buttons are pressed the LED goes on, then off after a certain amount of time. \n\nIn the picture below is my code and the serial COM. When i long press (long), aka longer then the 500 millisecond delay time, it works perfectly. But when i press and release within the 500millisecond (quick)window it registers two button presses.\n\nAnd i can not for the life of me figure out why/how this happens. There a sizable debounce time and it only happens when there is a delay after the if(button2.isPressed() && btn1State == 0);\n\nif there is no delay it works fine. \n\nWhat i want is that no matter if i press the two buttons quickly of slowly the LED only turns on and of once. Does anybody have an idea of how to fix this?\n\nps. setting a boolean statement to true or false after the two button presses (a flag variable) to dictate in another if statement if the LED should turn on doesn't work either\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jtwkj47juva1.jpg?width=1835&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b33d80b82818c2cce971e9016bdc084aa09ce4a",

I have all the other things set up except the wireless communication but I need to power them with a small power supply or similar. The light I'm using is a small reading lamp that needs 15v and then it's an Arduino Nano and an Arduino Uno. I ideally can recharge them and/or don't need to replace the battery often. I can't find anything that seems to do the right voltages ect online without a power socket (ie a transformer). Another issue is getting something that will power the lamp also, I'm just not sure if it's possible to split a larger power supply reasonably into a 15v and 5-12v. Any help is appreciated!",

I just need to set up a block that sends a string containing the desired alarm time and create a sketch that takes the text sent by the bluetooth as input and uses it in the rtc module instructions.\n\nOn the other hand, the second point is not so simple and intuitive. Or rather, I have found many resources on the internet that explain how to create an apk to send data from the arduino to the mobile phone. But my question is this: does the data sent in this way remain stored in the app? Or once the app is closed or the bluetooth deactivated will that data also be lost?\n\nThanks to anyone who decides to help me. See you soon.",

They are both getting 3.3v power from 3.3v buck converter which is fed by 2 18650 batteries in series. Yes I need the full 8.3v for another part of the circuit.\n\nThe issue is, when the relay is toggled \"ON\" it will stay on for a second or so and then the arduino resets. I have tried adding bypass caps (10 uF, it's what I had) to the power pins of the arduino, the power supply and the relay and it still doesn't work.\n\nWhat might be causing my issue? Is the relay coil simly trying to draw more current than my 3.3v Buck can supply?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should add that it works fine when it is getting USB power, it is when it is on battery power that it has this issue.",

        "body": "Hi again. So I've made a simple project where two motors will spin clockwise and anti-clockwise. The motors will be controlled via Bluetooth(using HC-05) using an Android app.\n\nI'm using Arduino Uno, L293D motor driver to control the two motors, and four 3.7V rechargeable batteries.\n\nI've made the app using the MIT App Inventor. I used TouchDown and TouchUp event handlers in the app. That means, the motor keeps spinning until I release the button. There are two buttons for two directions. The motors stop spinning when the button is released.\n\nNow, so far, it works as intended except, sometimes, something weird happens and the motors keep spinning forever. No matter if I release the button or even disconnect my phone from Bluetooth, the motors keep spinning. \n\nI added an emergency stop button to the app in case this happens. I press that to stop the motors. But even that doesn't work when that weird incident occurs. I tested if the Stop button even works and it works otherwise. But when that weird problem happens, I lose total control over the motors from my app. The only way to stop is to disconnect the power source.\n\nI tried to test and see when this happens. The first few times I press the spin buttons(say 5 to 6 times total), it works well. After that, this weird problem happens. Another thing I noticed is that it happens if I press one arrow button for too long.\n\nHere's the Arduino code:\n\n    int ena = 5;\n    int m1a = 6;\n    int m1b = 7;\n    \n    int enb = 9;\n    int m2a = 10;\n    int m2b = 11;\n    \n    void setup() {\n      // put your setup code here, to run once:\n      Serial.begin(9600);\n      pinMode(ena, OUTPUT);\n      pinMode(m1a, OUTPUT);\n      pinMode(m1b, OUTPUT);\n    \n      pinMode(enb, OUTPUT);\n      pinMode(m2a, OUTPUT);\n      pinMode(m2b, OUTPUT);\n    \n    }\n    \n    void loop() {\n      // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:\n      if (Serial.available()) {\n        char input = Serial.read();\n        Serial.println(input);\n    \n        // If upper arrow button is pressed\n        if (input == 'O') {\n          digitalWrite(m1a,HIGH);\n          digitalWrite(m1b,LOW);\n          analogWrite(ena, 150);\n    \n          digitalWrite(m2a,HIGH);\n          digitalWrite(m2b,LOW);\n          analogWrite(enb, 150);\n    \n        }\n        // If lower arrow button is pressed\n        else if (input == 'C') {\n          digitalWrite(m1b,HIGH);\n          digitalWrite(m1a,LOW);\n          analogWrite(ena, 150);\n    \n          digitalWrite(m2b,HIGH);\n          digitalWrite(m2a,LOW);\n          analogWrite(enb, 150);\n    \n        }\n        // If either arrow button is released or Stop button is pressed \n        else if (input == 'S') {\n          digitalWrite(m1b,LOW);\n          digitalWrite(m1a,LOW);\n    \n          digitalWrite(m2b,LOW);\n          digitalWrite(m2a,LOW);\n    \n        }\n    \n      }\n    \n    }\n\nYou can find the app logic [here](https://imgur.com/a/s5QO1BD). \n\nWhat's wrong with my project? I really need any kind of assistance. Thanks a lot.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMotors should spin when the Android app remote control button is pressed and stop when released. It does work the first few times but then malfunctions and the motors keep spinning forever. What can I do to fix it?",

However when I am not putting an object within range, the values are changing drastically which sometimes gets to a point whereit reads a false positive. Due to this, whenever I am searching for an enemy, the search loop suddenly gets falsely interrupted by a millisecond due to an outlier false positive.   \n\n\nMy question is that is there any fix for this IR using arduino code where it will not use the false positive reading to make my search code steady?

The Arduino also measures the water flow using a 5V water flow sensor ([this](http://www.mantech.co.za/datasheets/products/yf-s201_sea.pdf)).\n\nI have a few questions regarding the power supply:\n\n1. Can I supply power to the Arduino Uno by the Vin pin using the same 12V from the voltage regulator?\n2. Should I power the relay coils from the Arduino's 5V pin?\n3. Can I connect the wires from the voltage regulator to a breadboard rail, then supply 12V to the pump and the 2 valves?\n4.

(here is the Nano I purchased: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZ2BLHV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)\n \nI've been trying to do research on how to power the LEDs properly with enough voltage and mA rating. Ideally, I would like to use a 5V 10,000mA battery pack I have for my phone and run the Nano and LEDs off of the usb port. However, not sure if I really can do that. Ideally, I'd like to plug the Nano into the USB power bank through the USB-B port and wire the Neopixel strip Data line to D6 on Arduino, GND to GND, and VCC to the 5V pin on Arduino. But I've also seen some people saying that capacitors or additional resistors may be necessary. I don't really know. All research I've done has left me kind of confused and questioning if I can even use a Nano for 100 Neopixels. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n \nTLDR; How would I go about powering a single strip of 100 Neopixel LEDs with an Arduino Nano? Can I use a 5V power bank through the USB port, or would i have to power the LEDs directly from the power bank? If the later, then can you provide a schematic on how I would go about doing that?\n \nThank you all so much",

Inexpensive is preferred for obvious reasons but also because I hope to deploy many of these sensor stations.\n\nIf anything below is incorrect or could use clarification, please let me know. I don't know much about this stuff. \n\nAt the start of this project, I was getting ready to order a $10 [Sim 800L](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Smallest-Breakout-Quad-band-3-7-4-2V/dp/B01DLIJM2E) with a [Hologram](https://www.hologram.io/products/global-iot-sim-card/) sim card but then learned that it would not work very long since 2G and 3G are both ceasing to be offered. If my light research on the topic is correct, T-Mobile is the only network left with 2G coverage and they do not acknowledge they even offer that coverage and they do plan to end its service. I figured if the major carriers are retiring the hardware then the third-party carriers like Hologram lose it too. But maybe that is not correct. \n\nI would like my project to be useful for at least 5 years. The only 4G modules I found are relatively expensive compared to the 2G module. Some options I found were: \n\n* $65 [Makerfab's Maduino Zero 4G LTE(SIM7600X)](https://www.makerfabs.com/maduino-zero-4g-lte-sim7600.html) \n* $60 [BluesWireless LTE Cat-1 Notecard](https://shop.blues.io/collections/notecard/products/note-wbna-500) that would also require [an additional module](https://shop.blues.io/products/carr-b) \\+$15 (No SIM card)\n* $40 [ESP32 based bord](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802900907311.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US) \n\nThese all are a little pricier than what I was hoping for after seeing the 2G hardware price of $10. They also have very little support as far as tutorials and whatnot, so I am wondering... are there any other options out there? What does everyone else do? Is the best option forward really to drop $50+ just for a connection on each one of my sensor stations? \n\nThank you!",

        "body": " Hi yall,\n\nSo I'm trying to do a simple transmission between two nrf24l01 modules that will send and receive messages. I used two Arduino UNO R3 boards that have their own transmission and receiver code. I also attached a LED to the receiver to check for successful transmission.\n\nI've checked the hardware and it's solid (Did the continuity tests for each pin and all the various pins are accurately connected. I also had an experienced friend with a second pair of eyes look over the hardware and he said it looks good as well)\n\nI'm thinking I have a programming problem but I'm not sure because I've followed various resources exactly and there is still no transmission.\n\nCurrently, the output I get is that the receiver is only printing \"Searching for Signal\" and the transmission is only printing \"Sent: test\".\n\nI've left this running for hours and I still have no successful transmission (I did this by having a LED light up if it runs successfully at least once). The only time I achieved \"success\" was when I messed around with the MISO and MOSI pins. I also achieved success when testing the transmission from approximately 200 feet in an open area, but I was not able to replicate that.\n\nReceiver Code\n\n    #include <SPI.h> \n    #include <nRF24L01.h> \n    #include <RF24.h>  \n    RF24 radio(9, 10); // CE, CSN  \n    const byte address[6] = \"00001\";  \n    \n    void setup()  \n    {   \n    //NRF set up   \n    Serial.begin(9600);      \n    radio.begin();   \n    //radio.setChannel(115);   \n    radio.openReadingPipe(0, address);   \n    radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MAX);   \n    radio.setDataRate(RF24_250KBPS);   \n    radio.startListening();   \n    Serial.println(\"Initialize Listening\");    \n    //LED set up   \n    pinMode(4, OUTPUT); \n    }  \n    \n    void loop()  \n    {         \n    //Keep on pinging or test transmitter for alternative options   \n    if (radio.available())    \n    {     \n    //May need to turn off later     \n    Serial.println(\"Received signal\");     \n    char text[32] = {0};     \n    radio.read(&text, sizeof(text));      \n    //String receivedData = String(text);     \n    Serial.println(text);      \n    //Flash LED for successful transmission     \n    digitalWrite(4, HIGH);   \n    }   \n    \n    else  \n    {     \n    Serial.println(\"Searching for Signal\");     \n    delay(1000);     \n    digitalWrite(4, LOW);  \n    } \n    } \n\nTransmission Code\n\n    #include <SPI.h> \n    #include <nRF24L01.h> \n    #include <RF24.h>  \n    RF24 radio(9, 10); // CE, CSN  \n    \n    const byte address[6] = \"00001\";  \n    void setup() \n    {   \n    //NRF set up   \n    Serial.begin(9600);    \n    radio.begin();   \n    //radio.setChannel(115);    \n    radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MAX);   \n    radio.setDataRate(RF24_250KBPS);   \n    radio.openWritingPipe(address);   \n    radio.stopListening();    \n    Serial.println(\"Begin Transmitting\");    \n    //LED set up   \n    pinMode(5, OUTPUT); \n    }  \n    \n    void loop() \n    {   \n    //const char text[] = \"Transmitted\";   \n    char text[] = \"test\";    \n    \n    radio.write(&text, sizeof(text));   \n    Serial.print(\"Sent: \");   \n    Serial.println(text);   \n    digitalWrite(5, HIGH);   \n    delay(1000); \n    } \n\nThank you in advance!",

        "body": "Hey!I have a circuit with 2 74CH595 shift registers, wired up to 16 white LEDs. Without PWM the code works fine, but when I try to use an other code that uses the \"ShiftRegisterPWM\" library, random LEDs start to light up instead of the ones I defined in the code. If have the shiftregister variable set up with a shiftregister count to 1, and resolution to 16 the correct pin is lit up, but because I have two shift registers from the second 8 LEDs the defined pin number is lit up on that part too (so basically I have 2 LEDs lit up). But when I define the shiftregister with a count of 2, and a resolution of 16, random LEDs start to light up from the 16 LEDs (some even start to flicker).Here is the code with the library:\n\n    #include \"ShiftRegisterPWM.h\"\n    \n    ShiftRegisterPWM sr(2, 16);\n    void setup()\n    {\n      pinMode(2, OUTPUT); // sr data pin\n      pinMode(3, OUTPUT); // sr clock pin\n      pinMode(4, OUTPUT); // sr latch pin\n      \n      sr.interrupt(ShiftRegisterPWM::UpdateFrequency::SuperFast);\n    }\n    \n    void loop()\n    {\n      sr.set(12, 255);\n    }\n\nWith this code for example, the 3rd LED lights up and the 13th and 14th flicker on a lower brightness level. Am I missing something from the code? As I checked the wiring is correct.",

Sounds silly, but I am looking to integrate it with some of my homelab functionality to turn on my lights, computers and other things I have setup. \n\nUsing a \"light curtain\" setup to know if someone has entered the room, but would like to add something to confirm it is me who has entered or not.\n\nIs there some sort of component that I can attach to my backpack or keys that when it is in my room, notifies my system via the Arduino to execute a process? \n\nKind regards, cheers\n\nedit: I have forgot to mention that the opening for the room is next to a very small hallway which people walk through frequently. I thought about a PIR sensor inside the room, but could become inaccurate and annoying when I am constantly entering and leaving the room. That's why I am inquiring about an additional component that I can either have on my keys (has a specific place in my room) or on/inside my backpack (also has a specific place inside my room). \n\nI also just thought of some weighted sensor system could work when I put my items in a specific place, but it wouldn't let me know if someone else has entered a room. Is there some sort of radio based component?  Perhaps an RFID system?\n\nThanks again legends!",

        "body": "# ISSUE FIXED, DON'T READ IF YOU'RE HERE TO HELP ME\n\nHello there!\n\nI'm currently turning an old Samsung system keyboard (a keyboard with a joystick, encoder, and a few other fiddly bits) into a gaming controller (mainly for simulators) using UnoJoy (or in this case MegaJoy, becase I'm using a Mega 2560).I've decided to not rewire the original PCB keyswitch connections, because it would be a ton of work (and I lack a soldering iron suitable for such delicate work), also to be able to someday use the system keyboard again in its original state (when I find a replacement chip for the broken one on its motherboard), so I have to work with multiplexed keys, using the Keypad library by Mark Stanley and Alexander Breivig (built-in into the IDE).\n\nThe problem is, that I need to feed the output (keystrokes) from Keypad.h into the MegaJoy code, namely:\n\n    megaJoyControllerData_t getControllerData(void)\n    {\n      \n      // Set up a place for our controller data\n      //  Use the getBlankDataForController() function, since\n      //  just declaring a fresh dataForController_t tends\n      //  to get you one filled with junk from other, random\n      //  values that were in those memory locations before\n      megaJoyControllerData_t controllerData = getBlankDataForMegaController();\n      // Since our buttons are all held high and\n      //  pulled low when pressed, we use the \"!\"\n      //  operator to invert the readings from the pins\n    \n      for (int i = 8; i < 54; i++){\n        controllerData.buttonArray[(i - 2) / 8] |= (!digitalRead(i)) << ((i - 2) % 8);\n      }\n      \n      // Set the analog sticks\n      //  Since analogRead(pin) returns a 10 bit value,\n      //  we need to perform a bit shift operation to\n      //  lose the 2 least significant bits and get an\n      //  8 bit number that we can use \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[0] = analogRead(A0);\n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[1] = analogRead(A1);\n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[2] = analogRead(A2); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[3] = analogRead(A3); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[4] = analogRead(A4); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[5] = analogRead(A5); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[6] = analogRead(A6); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[7] = analogRead(A7); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[8] = analogRead(A8); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[9] = analogRead(A9); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[10] = analogRead(A10); \n      controllerData.analogAxisArray[11] = analogRead(A11);\n      \n      // And return the data!\n      return controllerData;\n    }\n\nI think I have to replace `!digitalRead(i)` with a variable from Keypad. I've thought of using `keypad.isPressed(key)`, and to get the `key` variable I wanted to use  `int key = keypad.getKey();` so I can iterate through it with the `for()` loop, and the `getKey()` gives me an integer, everything seems alright, but for some reason, the numbers I get are random at best...\n\nI've coded a little Serial code to see the value it gives, and I've organised them into a table (number in brackets mean the digital pin used in that row/column)\n\nEDIT: Changed values, because I've noticed that I've got row pins inverted for whatever reason\n\n||Col 1 (8)|Col 2 (9)|Col 3 (10)|Col 4 (11)|Col 5 (12)|Col 6 (13)|Col 7 (14)|Col 8 (15)|Col 9 (16)|Col 10 (17)|Col 11 (18)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Row 1 (2)|48|49|50|51|52|53|54|55|56|57|97|\n|Row 2 (3)|98|99|100|101|102|103|104|105|106|107|108|\n|Row 3 (4)|109|110|111|112|113|114|115|116|117|118|119|\n|Row 4 (5)|120|121|122|65|66|67|68|69|70|71|72|\n|Row 5 (6)|73|74|75|76|77|78|79|80|81|82|83|\n|Row 6 (7)|84|85|86|87|88|89|90|33|64|35|36|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~So, three questions.~~\n\n1. ~~Why do I get such random, yet somewhat organised numbers? I've looked through Key.h, Key.cpp, Keypad.h, Keypad.cpp files, but found no explanation for such behaviour.~~\n2. ~~How do I change those numbers to something a bit more organised?~~\n3. ~~Assuming my method is wrong,~~ how can I properly extrapolate a boolean variable regarding its state for each key in an iterative manner (for() loop)?\n\nAnother EDIT: I've just noticed the connection between characters in  `char keys[rows][cols]` and the numbers. Those are just ASCII values for a certain character. \\*facepalm\\*\n\n*Another* another EDIT: Kind of a \"if you cannot fix it with a hammer, you just need a bigger hammer\" kind of a fix, but I've managed to make it work by just replacing the old `char keys[rows][cols]` table with a new one, that consists of just integers from 1 to 66 (as shown below)\n\n    Old:\n      {'0','1','2','3','4','5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'a'},\n      {'b','c','d','e','f','g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l'},\n      {'m','n','o','p','q','r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w'},\n      {'x','y','z','A','B','C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H'},\n      {'I','J','K','L','M','N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S'},\n      {'T','U','V','W','X','Y', 'Z', '!', '@', '#', '$'},\n    New:\n        { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11},\n        {12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22},\n        {23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33},\n        {34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44},\n        {45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55},\n        {56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66},\n\n...and it works like a charm :)\n\nProbably should delete the post now, but I'll leave it be in case someone is as dumb as me and runs into the same issue in the future",

Can anyone explain to me why a resistor is needed between row 5 on the breadboard and ground? This part of the kit you are taking an input on pin 2 and depending on that input (high or low) outputting on pin 12 to turn the LED on. So you can manipulate the switch from your 5v base output and if that current flows into pin 2, then it sees the high value, and turns on the LED.\n\nI understand that if you connect it to ground and the switch is turned on, you need the resistor to prevent a short to ground with the switch on.

Since it\u2019s only 3 wires I imagine it wouldn\u2019t be too crazy to set up an arduino to intercept the electrical signals going through, maybe with some extra hardware to get voltages in good ranges? (I\u2019m pretty rusty with electrical work).\n\nDoes anyone know of any guides for this or have any ideas on how they\u2019d go about setting this up? I have a multimeter so I can measure voltages and such but I am not entirely well-versed in using it (I think I measured 20V of A/C between front and trans when the doorbell pusher is shorted\u2026 not sure if I measured it right though).\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of the current chime for reference https://i.imgur.com/V4EWE64.jpg\n\nThanks, sorry for my lack of knowledge here \ud83d\ude05 Let me know if there\u2019s a better forum to ask a question like this",

But, as this keyboard has a ton of keys as well,  I'd love to be able to use them as controller buttons as well, but the problem is, that they are multiplexed.  \n\n\nThat is, the outputs are connected in pairs (except one), and the inputs are two separate signals:\n\n[On the schematic H level represents the GND, and \\\\\"Outputs\\\\\" are Arduino Mega digital pins set to INPUT\\_PULLUP](https://preview.redd.it/z1vojhcrm0va1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d98ee7edde481b964241778bb0f9b2d2b4c5a40a)\n\nAnd now, if I connect GND to both the \"Input\" pins, and press any of the keys in a pair, they work as an \"OR\" gate, whichever from the pair is pressed sends the input, doesn't matter which, *quod erat demonstrandum*:  \n\n\n[Key 1, pair 1 pressed](https://preview.redd.it/bbbf9avvp0va1.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=99c887e0bc9ba4d43290a62beec5832dc429ddc5)\n\n[Key 2, pair 1 pressed](https://preview.redd.it/3hcstkyyp0va1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6a2bf9ceb73203b391556fd66be65ab7a84ca4a3)\n\nFrom what I've gathered, I have to make it, that GND is switched between the two inputs, and then if say \"Output 1\" gets pulled low, when \"Input 1\" is active (has GND potential on it), then it means \"Button 1\" is pressed. But, if it gets pulled low when \"Input 2\" is active, then it means that \"Button 2\" was pressed, etc.  \n\n\n[Input 1 active, button 2 pressed, output 2 registering, so the PC sees \\\\\"Button 2\\\\\" keystroke.](https://preview.redd.it/ebrbarkmq0va1.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=974ce285ae18ebc1464a4f895b3820d094585fdc)\n\n[Input 2 active, \\\\\"Button 2\\\\\" pressed, output 2 not registering, PC sees no keystroke.](https://preview.redd.it/m4p1btbiq0va1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7359f2c71f00a488e0be6e6ab0436a79e7b479cd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Input 1 active, \\\\\"Button 3\\\\\" pressed, output 2 not registering, so the PC sees no keystroke.](https://preview.redd.it/lrvxge1rq0va1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1f6c322e2da5418344c37aa85f0ef4f9599d818)\n\n[Input 2 active, \\\\\"Button 3\\\\\" pressed, output 2 registering, so the PC sees \\\\\"Button 3\\\\\" keystroke.](https://preview.redd.it/8bti7gy7q0va1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b7d40d98c4e0b77530058d3c80d642d36deeb4e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd before anyone says anything about using the Analog Input and resistors, I am aware of that solution, but sadly, all the fiddly analog bits use all the available Analog Inputs, so I cannot get away with doing it that way.  \n\n\nI'm completely new to multiplexing buttons, never needed so many inputs on an Arduino (I've to shamefully confess, that I've had this Mega laying around, because my method of overcoming the \"not enough digital inputs\" problem by just slapping a Mega into the project because of its enormous GPIO pool :v), and I'm wondering... Is there a way to make it directly in software, or must I buy a multiplexer IC? From what I assume, I'd have to link the \"Inputs\" to digital OUTPUTs, then if I send out H (+5VDC), then that \"Input\" is disabled, and when I send L (0VDC, GND), that \"Input\" is enabled...",

So far I've found the solution might involve a piezo to catch the percussive sound (I'm still thinking if it should be clapping or an actual drumming surface). However, it's important that this device does the following:  \n1) Plays a basic rythm along with a feedback (could be a led light).\n\n2) Recognices the percussive sound as an input.\n\n3) If the time was coordinated, to give you a possitive feedback.  \n\n\nThis is the basics. On more advanced functions, I would like it to have a tempo knob and 2 rows of leds, one for the tempo, other displaying the rythm. Do you know any similar projects I may look for inspiration?",

        "body": "Hi all, I've been working on ESP32-CAM project, that provides over-network camera control, with I2C sensor/display/whatever connectivity to the Cloud, *local* relay control, and *custom* URI parameters.\n\nThe idea is to have an easy to setup, *reliable,* remote camera, sensors, outlet/relay control, with Cloud & phone connectivity. Not too much to ask of the lowly ERSP32-CAM, right? *RIGHT?!?!?*\n\nEventually, I'll get one to control another, like in a mesh-type of system. Using URI parameters. But that's in the future.\n\nIn a nutshell, my project includes *all* of the amazing WebServer features of [EasyTarget](https://github.com/easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver) *plus*:\n\n* Supports *SSD1306* display, *AHT20* Temp/Humi sensor, on I2C *custom* pins 14 & 15,\n   * The goal is to allow for *multiple* sensors to be connected using as few pins as possible.\n   * After lots of testing *these* pins work best. It was *difficult* to find *working* I2C code.\n   * I'm using a [keystone](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=5384) network jack wired to the ESP for I2C pins, 5V power, & DIOs.\n   * I2C multiplexer may control *more* relays *and* we still have a couple of direct DIO outputs left.  \n\n* MQTT for *bi-directional* Cloud control & data display ([AdafruitIO](https://io.adafruit.com/) for now),\n   * I created a **free** AdafruitIO dashboard with graphs, switches, and a slider.\n   * The ESP connects to AdafruitIO, reports sensor readings, sets virtual switches, & reads the slider value.  \n\n* A *virtual* slider in the Cloud that sets a value for the ESP to read (set a temp threshold for example)\n   * I'm controlling a humidifier (relay), using the slider as a target Rh. Hysteresis *is included*.  \n\n* Re-use last IP and network connection *after* a reboot\n   * The ESP32-CAM can be flaky and unreliable. A reboot *usually* solves any issue. I have it rebooting after almost *any failure*. The last successful WiFi connection info is *now* saved to flash.\n   * Upon reboot, your network may assign a different IP. *Well, not anymore*. Now the ESP will try to use the last successful network info to re-connect. If that fails, then it will try the other SSIDs.  \n\n* You may add *multiple* WiFi SSIDs to connect to (*strongest* one *automatically* chosen first)\n   * I've modified the code to allow for a *list* of SSIDs to try to connect to.\n   * As the first entry, you could add your *cell phone hotspot* as a test AP, and it will *always* attempt this first. Upon failure, *then* it will choose the *strongest*, available AP next.  \n\n* 1-wire MMC mode (frees-up DIO pins on ESP)\n   * MMC features still work fine, but this frees-up a couple of pins for I2C.\n   * MMC speed may be slower for some applications (hi frame-rate + hi-res image saved to MMC for example.)  \n\n* Global Serial output *disable*\n   * I've added a simple way to toggle/disable the serial.print commands throughout the sketch.\n   * This allows you to USB-troubleshoot when not using the 2 DIOs used for (USB) serial, at the same time.\n\nOh, and you can control a relay, or two, *locally*. Just wire it to one of the available DIO pins. I'm using the RJ45 network jack to do that. I made a 3D printed housing for the ESP, micro-USB connector, AHT21, & RJ45 jack. *I found that the ESP generates way too much heat to use the AHT21 in the same housing, even with tons of venting, so I don't install that in the housing now*. It goes to the I2C pins of the RJ45 connector instead, and is located at the other end of a network cable.\n\nThe 3D printed housing (picture attached) features:\n\n* *Lots* of venting\n* [External Antenna](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802084396612.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.21.2ef97c68Yjvdrb&algo_pvid=2f4e5d64-ce75-4e56-bee6-46eb37e1c23a&algo_exp_id=2f4e5d64-ce75-4e56-bee6-46eb37e1c23a-10&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21USD%210.46%210.46%21%21%21%21%21%40212279a216819314173904674d0704%2112000019845222105%21sea%21US%21140117597&curPageLogUid=lAsXXOZIOHZt) mounting hole.\n* Hole for hanging from a ceiling, using a string/chain/hook.\n* [Micro-USB connector](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832601087519.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.5.f2ea35aesTSjeV&algo_pvid=4370999a-af5f-4ef2-a86e-eec4c6182b90&algo_exp_id=4370999a-af5f-4ef2-a86e-eec4c6182b90-2&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21USD%210.93%210.82%21%21%21%21%21%4021021b4716819313100721547d0701%2163471177829%21sea%21US%21140117597&curPageLogUid=sVcsvelIZrDf) mount.\n* Hole to mount RJ45 Keystone Jack (to connect extra stuff.)\n* Clip for routing the USB power cable (whole thing can hang in space from USB cable that way.)\n   * I picked up several *45-degree* micro-USB cables to provide power.

I have a spare Arduino Mega 2560 laying around, and I want to use it as the brains for a 4-axis game controller with a ton of keys (thusly, Mega 2560, because it has a ton of GPIO).  \n\n\nI've read online that it is possible to reprogram the built-in Atmega 16u2 on the Arduino Mega board to report as a HID-compliant gamepad instead of the usb-to-serial as it is by default.  \n\n\nBut then, I'd need to program the Mega 2560 through an outside programmer, because the 16u2 ain't doing it anymore after flashing the gamepad firmware. So, I've thought to use another spare Arduino (Nano V3 on CH340/Atmega328p, clone) as a \"programmer\" (and wanted to test it out before I flash the 16u2 and then have to reverse it because it won't work or something) for the Atmega2560.  \n\n\nSo far I've tried connecting the Nano to my PC via an USB cable, then connecting pins of the Arduinos like so:  \n\n\nNano -> Mega  \n5V -> 5V  \nGND -> GND  \nRX0 -> RX0 (0)  \nTX1 -> TX0 (1)  \n\n\nThen, in the Arduino IDE, I've selected \"Board\" -> \"Arduino Mega\", \"Processor\" -> \"Mega 2560\", \"Port\" -> Arduino Nano port (in my case COM13), and \"Programmer\" -> \"AVRISP mkII\", so basically the configuration that I used (successfully) to upload a program to the Mega directly through its USB port, just switching the COM port to reflect the Nano COM port. Sadly, it didn't work, the RX/TX LEDs on Nano and Mega didn't give any signs of life, and the IDE just hanged trying to upload, then spat this out:  \n\n\n    avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout\n    avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout\n    avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout\n    avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout\n    avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout\n    avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout\n    avrdude: stk500v2_getsync(): timeout communicating with programmer\n    An error occurred while uploading the sketch\n\nI am probably doing a lot of stuff wrong, but I'm quite a newb when it comes to Arduino (I've only used those two boards for around eight years or so, but it was always some straight-forward stuff, like \"write a sketch -> select the correct settings in the \"Tools\" menu -> upload the sketch -> Arduino does what I wanted it to\"  \n\n\nIs the idea of using the CH340G on my Nano board to program the Atmega2560 even doable? And, preferably, without modifying the Nano board physically (like desoldering the Atmega328p) ? I'd rather not meddle with the board physically, since I currently don't have a decent soldering iron (all I have is an old pistol-style transformer iron, my soldering / hot air station was borrowed by a friend and now he's abroad, so I have no way of getting it back in a looooong time, I assume)",

Math/physics/chem- wherever a calculator is permitted. There will never be a shortage of desperate students on the verge of failing their courses, and AI isn\u2019t going anywhere either. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019d need: \n\n* Custom 3D printed calculator cases & buttons\n* Button switches & functioning button mechanisms\n* A small camera with a quality that can reliably interpret text in a variety of lighting conditions\n* 2.8\u201d full-color, backlit LED display\n* A \u201cbrain\u201d such as an Arduino, etc. that can run a variety of software\n* Battery\n\nAll of the components would need to fit in a 7.59 x 3.42 x 0.25-0.5\u201d case\n\nAnd also the software\u2026\n\n* The main UI should mimic exactly that of a TI-84\u2019s. This means that all data processed through the camera should be returned where any other math operation is returned. This would involve running a modified version of the TI-84 software that can interact with other software like OCR and API\u2019s.  \n* An OCR software that will reliably interpret, copy, then return whatever text is presented in front of the camera. \n\nNow IF I can replicate the vision I have in my mind I am VERY confident I can brand/market this thing to make it sell. I am willing to put pretty much all my time into this. \n\nThe first step is I need to know if this can be built at a cheap enough price so that people are still willing to pay and the ROI is descent.

I suspect this comes from some assumptions made in the equation but I also don't think it would be that big of a deal. I've tested 5 different sensors and get fairly uniform results between them (i.e. the average error between measured and actual distance is far greater than the error in the measured distance between sensors).\n\nFrom the data below, you can see that there is a significant error between the actual (ruler) and measured (arduino) distance calculated from the temperature (thermistor) and duration (HC-SR04).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73xr96nwlnua1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f68e6c6a54b26e5f526fd431455b3001f7c8fd3\n\nHere is the equation I'm using for temp, cross-referenced from Wikipedia and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F1B_N6LuKw&t=1016s):\n\nc = 331.3 + T \\* 0.606\n\nwhere T is in degC and c is in m/s.\n\nI am confident in the temp (cross-referenced with my home thermostat multiple times) and duration values, so inaccuracy in the sound speed equation is all I can come up with.

Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this.\n\nSo I'm making an Arduino Smart curtain that will be controlled by an Android app via Bluetooth. I'm using HC-05 module.\n\nTo make the project more customizable, I thought of making my own Android app. I learned some Java and basic Android dev. \n\nBut it seems it's not enough. Just setting up the Bluetooth connection seems like impossible. I'm following some tutorials but they are quite outdated and don't work. And I'm also on a tight deadline. \n\nSo now I'm thinking of using some No code platform. I've heard of MIT app inventor before. But how good is it really? Will I be able to set up the button events as I like?\n\nFor example, I'd like to have two buttons. One for opening and one for closing. I want to open/close the curtain as long as the buttons is pressed and stop when button is released. \n\nIs this possible to do in any No code platform app builder? \n\nThanks for reading and sorry for the long post.",

I've researched and I'm kinda overwhelmed by the amount of boards/ kits there are and what exactly to use, and I couldn't find someone with a project similar to mine. \n\nAs for coding, I've taken a C++ course in uni and I'm currently taking python, and I don't really have a problem putting time in to learn Arduino-specific language.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Are the sensors I want adequate? The light sensor is self-explanatory but is an accelerometer the right choice?  Should I keep the accelerometer as it is more versatile? i.e  I can customize light levels based on how hard I'm breaking\n* What exactly should I buy? I want something small to fit in my bike but also because I'm probably going to need to make a waterproof housing as weather is unpredictable here.\n\nLastly, any extra suggestions on this are welcome. This is my first project ever with an Arduino, please do tell if there are things I haven't considered.\n\nEdit: I currently have a dynamo connected to my rear wheel that lights up my front and rear halogen bulbs, idk if this is relevant/ can be incorporated somehow.",

        "body": "Hello! I am working on a project for school, in which I am aiming to control an RGB LED strip with an arduino. The strip is NOT neopixels (this is the strip i have: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/4245](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4245)), and so I am wondering if there is an easy way to go about this. I know there is an Adafruit neopixel library, but this won't work, since I previously stated my strip is not neopixel. \n\nAlso, I want to use potentiameters to control the color and brightness of the strip, so I thought using the HSV color mode would work best in this situation, as I could potentially map the potentiameter value to the entire range of Hue and Value, as opposed to dealing with the separate channels of R, G, and B. \n\nI don't know much about arduino coding (or coding in general), so I would greatly appreciate any help anyone has to give.",

        "body": "I wanted to share with you all about the benefits of 3D-printed enclosures for our beloved Arduino Uno and Leonardo boards. As we all know, these boards are incredibly versatile and powerful, but they are also vulnerable to damage from dirt, dust, and shorts.\n\nFortunately, 3D printing technology has made it easier than ever to create custom enclosures for our Arduino boards. By enclosing our boards in a protective case, we can shield them from harmful elements and extend their lifespan.\n\nThere are many different types of 3D-printed enclosures available online, ranging from simple cases to more complex designs that include space for additional components such as sensors, LEDs, and buttons. Many of these designs are free and can be modified to suit our specific needs.\n\nSome of the benefits of using a 3D-printed enclosure for our Arduino boards include:\n\n1. Protection from dirt and dust: By enclosing our boards in a case, we can prevent dirt and dust from accumulating on the board and interfering with its functionality. This is particularly important for outdoor projects want or projects that involve a lot of movement or handling.\n2. Protection from damage: Accidents happen, and our Arduino boards are no exception. By placing them in an enclosure, we can help protect them from accidental drops, bumps, and scratches.\n3. Protection from shorts: One of the biggest risks to our Arduino boards is the possibility of a short circuit. By enclosing our boards in an insulated case, we can reduce the risk of a short circuit and help ensure our projects operate safely.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking to protect your Arduino Uno or Leonardo board from harm, I highly recommend investing in a 3D-printed enclosure. Not only will it keep your board safe, but it can also give your project a more professional and polished look.\n\nThe files were designed by: [https://www.taito3d.co.za/](https://www.taito3d.co.za/)\n\nThe files can be downloaded for free here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:194866](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:194866)",

        "body": "In this project, I have introduced a compact stereo digital FM  transmitter circuit that operates in the frequency range of 87MHz to  108MHz. The frequency can be adjusted using two tactile push-buttons,  with a 0.1MHz step size. The heart of the circuit is an ATMega8  microcontroller, which communicates with a 0.96-inch SPI OLED display  and the KT0803L FM transmitter chip via an I2C interface. You can  directly connect a microphone or an AUX cable to the board to broadcast  your desired sound, such as playing a piece of music from your  cellphone, computer, \u2026 etc. After conducting some tests, it was found  that the circuit operates quite stable, and the received sound is clear  and sharp.\n\nTo design the schematic and PCB, I used Altium Designer  23 and shared the project with my friends to get their feedback and  updates using Altium-365. The fast component search engine (Octopart)  allowed me to quickly consider components\u2019 information and also generate  the BOM. To get high-quality fabricated boards, I sent the Gerber files  to PCBWay. I am confident that utilizing this circuit will be an  enjoyable and fulfilling experience for you.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 [https://www.pcbway.com/blog/technology/Stereo\\_Digital\\_FM\\_Transmitter\\_Circuit\\_64d799f3.html](https://www.pcbway.com/blog/technology/Stereo_Digital_FM_Transmitter_Circuit_64d799f3.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqi0ngr1psxa1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=907d84adeff4267c5a1950b2d3bc4d63969978df",
