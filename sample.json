Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02301) \n\nAbstract: \n\n> Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging because they are memory inefficient and compute-intensive for practical applications. In reaction, researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human labels or distilling using LLM-generated labels. However, finetuning and distillation require large amounts of training data to achieve comparable performance to LLMs. We introduce Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism that (a) trains smaller models that outperform LLMs, and (b) achieves so by leveraging less training data needed by finetuning or distillation. Our method extracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for small models within a multi-task training framework. We present three findings across 4 NLP benchmarks: First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanism achieves better performance with much fewer labeled/unlabeled training examples. Second, compared to LLMs, we achieve better performance using substantially smaller model sizes. Third, we reduce both the model size and the amount of data required to outperform LLMs; our 770M T5 model outperforms the 540B PaLM model using only 80% of available data on a benchmark task.",

        "body": "During  the recent earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg answered a question from Eric  Sheridan of Goldman Sachs on Meta's AI strategy, opportunities to  integrate into products, and why they open source models and how it  would benefit their business.\n\nI found the reasoning to be very sound and promising for the OSS and AI community.\n\nThe  biggest risk from AI, in my opinion, is not the doomsday scenarios that  intuitively come to mind but rather that the most powerful AI systems  will only be accessible to the most powerful and resourceful  corporations.\n\nQuote copied from Ben Thompson's write up on Meta's earning in his [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2023/facebook-earnings-generative-ai-and-messaging-monetization-open-source-and-ai/) which goes beyond AI. *It's behind a paywall but I highly recommend it personally.*\n\nSome noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly\n\n* We\u2019re just playing a different game on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon\n* We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we\u2019ll need to figure out a way to do that.\n* ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools\n* Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time.\n* On  PyTorch: It\u2019s generally been very valuable for us to provide that  because now  all of the best developers across the industry are using  tools that  we\u2019re also using internally.\n* I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem.\n\nFor  all the negative that comes out of the popular discourse on Meta, I  think their work to open source key tech tools over the last 10 years  has been exceptional, here's hoping it continues into this decade of AI  and pushes other tech giants to also realize the benefits of Open  Source.\n\nFull Transcript:\n\n>Right  now most of the companies that are training large language  models have  business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. I  think **there\u2019s an** **important opportunity to help create an  open ecosystem.**  If we can help be a part of this, then much of the  industry will  standardize on using these open tools and help improve  them further. So  this will make it easier for other companies to  integrate with our  products and platforms as we enable more  integrations, and that will  help our products stay at the leading edge  as well.  \nOur  approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly  open. We  open source many of our state of the art models so people can   experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM   to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperforms larger   models and has proven quite popular. We\u2019ve also open-sourced three other   groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model   weights \u2014 Segment Anything, DinoV2, and our Animated Drawings tool \u2014  and  we\u2019ve gotten positive feedback on all of those as well.  \nI  think that there\u2019s an important distinction between the products we  offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software  that we write to support that. And historically, whether it\u2019s the Open  Compute project that we\u2019ve done or just open sourcing a lot of the   infrastructure that we\u2019ve built, we\u2019ve historically open sourced a lot   of that infrastructure, even though we haven\u2019t open sourced the code for   our core products or anything like that.  \nAnd the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of  the other companies in the space, **we\u2019re not selling a cloud computing service** **where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we\u2019re building proprietary.** For us, **it\u2019s way better if the industry  standardizes on the basic tools that we\u2019re using**  and therefore we can benefit from the improvements that others make and  others\u2019 use of those tools can, in some cases like Open Compute, **drive down the costs** of  those things which make our business more efficient too. So I think to  some degree **we\u2019re just playing a different game** on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us.  \nSo overall, I think **that that\u2019s going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools**.  But of  course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be  specific and  integrated with the things that we do. So it\u2019s not that  everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs  to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products, but  I think in  terms of the basic models, **I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem** here, which I think is something that\u2019s  going to be important.  \nOn the AI tools, and we have a bunch of history here, right? So if you  if you look at what we\u2019ve done with **PyTorch**,  for example, which has  generally become the standard in the industry  as a tool that a lot of  folks who are building AI models and different  things in that space use,  **it\u2019s generally been very valuable** for us to provide that because now  all of the **best developers across the industry are using tools that  we\u2019re also using internally**.  So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we  can easily integrate it into the things that we\u2019re doing. When we  improve something, it improves other products too. Because it\u2019s  integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to  make integrations with products, it\u2019s much easier to  make sure that  developers and other folks are compatible with the things  that we need  in the way that our systems work.  \nSo there are a lot of advantages, but **I view this more as a kind of back end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the  product side**,  but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the  leading edge  and integrate more broadly with the community and also make  the way we  run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There  are a  number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example. Open Compute  is  another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to   incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own   infrastructure.  \nSo I think that  there\u2019s, our incentives I think are basically  aligned towards moving in  this direction. Now that said, there\u2019s a lot  to figure out, right? So  when you asked if there are going to be other opportunities, I hope so. I  can\u2019t speak to what all those things might  be now. This is all quite  early in getting developed. **The better we do at the foundational work, the more opportunities** I think that will come and present themselves. So I think that that\u2019s all stuff that we need to  figure out. But at least **at the base level, I think we\u2019re generally incentivized to move in this direction**. And we also need to figure out  how to go in that direction over time.  \nI  mean, I mentioned LLaMA before and I also want to be clear that  while  I\u2019m talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA  is a  model that we only really made available to researchers and there\u2019s  a  lot of really good stuff that\u2019s happening there. But a lot of the  work  that we\u2019re doing, I think, **we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we\u2019ll need to figure out a way to do that.**",

        "body": "I've been doing some browsing on how neurons work and what follows is the conclusion I've come to.\n\nThe functionality of biological neurons is impossible to emulate with current microcomputing technology. This is because biological neurons have 2 important features that are expensive to imitate:\n\n1.\tIt is possible for any two biological neurons to connect. Since their cell body, along with their axons and dendrites, is able to move freely, two correlated neurons will eventually find and connect to each other if given enough time. The only way to mimic this behavior in a single-processor computer without sacrificing time is by making a fully connected graph of the neurons, which is awful because it requires n\\^2 space.\n\n2.\tEach neuron operates in parallel. This means increases in number of neurons only require more mass, which is much more freely available than the extra time that a single-processor computer would need to add the same number of neurons. For instance, the human brain has \\~86 billion neurons. Assuming a 1 GHz oscillator, and that each neuron only requires 1 cycle to calculate its value, a single-processor computer would still take a whole 8.6 seconds to calculate the state of the brain after 1 time step. The human brain runs the same time step in, well, much less time than that.\n\nSo basically, in order to emulate a brain, a single-processor computer would have to make some tradeoff between n\\^2 space and n time, neither of which can be afforded.\n\nThoughts?",

        "body": "Hi there!\n\nBeen struggling on a my first Arduino project.\n\nBasically I have a controller that is supposed to light up specific LEDs on a strip.\n\nMy current issue is that the LEDs do not light up, or in some cases, just the first one does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have attached a diagram of my current wiring setup  \n\n\n[Diagram](https://preview.redd.it/8ie0b43qmvxa1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f9db9199e98b1355a5845320a0e6603f87bc1fc)\n\nI am using:  \n\n\n* Nano 33 Sense Rev2 BLE\n* 5V WS2811 LEDs (200 of them)\n* Power supply is meanwell lpv-60-5\n* The NeoPixelBus library\n* Link to specific codebase I am using for this build [https://github.com/FabianRig/ArduinoMoonBoardLED](https://github.com/FabianRig/ArduinoMoonBoardLED)  \n\n\nBehaviour I am seeing:\n\n* Most of the time, nothing lights up after connecting and specifying lights to light up.\n* Oddly enough, sometimes the first LED will pop on if I mess with the ground or data pin. Colour is not always consistent. I can't 100% reliably make this happen every time\n\nThings I have tested\n\n* I bought a little strand tester online. It lights up all strings. Wanted to rule out the LEDs as the issue\n* Checked voltage at end of the LED lines - and looks good at 5v\n* Tried changing data pin in code and wiring to see if that helped at all\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a bit lost on what to look into next. Hoping someone wiser than me knows what I am doing wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple spitball ideas I had worth looking into maybe\n\n* I have seen some people mention that it could be a good idea to add a resister in data line to clean up signal a bit. Got one of those on order and waiting for it to show up\n* I also stumbled across some reading that perhaps the data line from the arduino is not 5v in my setup, and it may need to be? And I may need to add something in line there to pump from 3.3 to 5v. A bit over my head",
